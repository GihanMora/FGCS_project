Are your moods are like an elevator with no control buttons? Mine are.
Ground floor ... I feel normal, content, just quietly getting on with ordinary, everyday life, loving my family and friends. This is as it should be. And maybe there's nothing wrong with me after all. Live.
Going up, top floor. Oh look! There's a shiny thing! I want to sing! Let's go buy stuff! Let's have a big party and invite the world! What could possibly go wrong! Woooooo hoooooooo! Play.
Going up (a different day) top floor. What do you mean you don't agree with me! I'm right! Why don't you think like me? Keep up! How can you be so illogical? I'll f-ing shred you if you don't do what I want! Rage.
Going down, lower ground floor. Flat, listless, can't be bothered. Can still function but it's a drag. Cope
Going down, basement. I'm never getting out of bed again. I'm useless, worthless. Total idiot, how could I ever imagine I could do anything, nothing ever goes right because I'm wrong. I'm a burden to everyone. Hide.
Welcome to my bipolar world. It's always been my world, but it's only recently I've seen it for what it is. About 15 years ago I was diagnosed with clinical depression during one of my 'basement' times. I had a lot of lower ground floor times too, on and off, and I kept out of the basement (so I thought) with alcohol. Until that took me into the blackest ever basement with only one obvious way out. Having survived doing something very dangerous I realised I had to stop drinking or I really would die.
I never took much notice of the playful times or the anger, that was just me, I was fun sometimes, and sometimes I was a devastating bitch. Ha! Deal with it people!
Well, yes, but in time the elevator started going up and down too quickly and, as I became more aware and more knowledgeable about mental health I realised this wasn't good. Doctor. Diagnosis. Bipolar 2. Lithium. 
So, I've started this thread in the hope that other bipolar folks will join me, to share experiences and strategies. In my 'beginners' understanding, we are different from other fellow travellers of the back dog. While we experience depression as many others on this site do, the hypomanic or manic ups and, for some the rapid cycling that can happen, are experiences unto themselves.
I want to learn more, and I want to share with others. I hope my fellow elevators will join me here.
BTW, it's a ground floor day in my head today! Yay!
Love
Kaz Thank you ladies, what treasures you are. A gift to this site and to me. xx
Sherie - yes it's taken a while to do this, but I had to get something of a grip on it before I felt I could post about it. It's strange ... the diagnosis doesn't change anything (except the treatment) I'm still me like I've always been. But boy has it open an emotional and intellectual can of worms.
 There's the looking back - if I'd been diagnosed years ago what things might I have avoided? Maybe I'd never have become an alcoholic, maybe I could have helped my daughter (also bipolar I've just found out! She's know for 10 years and not told me until now), maybe I would have understood my mum better (never diagnosed but knowing what I do now, most definitely - my doc says it's genetic). Maybe I wouldn't have done, bought, committed myself to so many things that didn't turn out right. Maybe I wouldn't have had the 'breakdown' that took me out of a job I loved and into drunken dwelling in the basement for a year.
But then, I know if those things hadn't happened, I wouldn't be who I am and where I am now. I wouldn't have met my Pom, love of my life and everything to me. And I tell myself 'don't look back Kaz, look ahead'. 
The trouble with looking ahead though is that knowing how unrealistic and misguided I can be, how I can overreach and 'get a bee in my bonnet' about things, I now doubt myself. I decide to do something - is it a good idea? Why do I think everyone will agree? Will they? Maybe I'm wrong, just having a bipolar moment, tomorrow it will look as ridiculous as it is. 
I guess where I'm at now is being aware that I must not let it stop me entirely ... I could be wrong, I might have silly ideas, I might get angry and say the wrong thing, but if I doubt myself all the time I'll be immobilised. And hiding in the darkness isn't an option. Been there too many times, and I survived for a reason. To be here, now, with my love, my kids, my friends, and to help others. And I'm staying.
Thanks for your kind words lovelies. Love youse. xx I'm such an impatient bugger. Two weeks on new medication and I feel no different. I want it to work NOW.
I'm still cycling ... good for a few days before and during the weekend, then right down on Monday and yesterday, although that was probably inevitable given the events in Orlando. 
Last night I was a mix, sad and sinking but couldn't shut my brain down. Not hyper in my body but a million miles an hour in my mind. When I slept I had very strange dreams.
But today so far I'm better than I expected to be.
Anyone out there got good tips for slowing a racing mind? And if anyone has gone onto lithium, how long was it till you knew whether it was having an effect? This is exhausting.
Thanks, Kaz Thanks xx 
Rob I like the distractions too, I'm just not good at focus when I'm like this. I want to do them all and more all at the same time. 
Paul - I'll have a look for that movie. Thanks mate! Thanks Carol - I've wondered about colouring in. Might give it a go. I'm impressed that you took so many actions. I need to make myself do that instead of just staying 'stuck' in my thoughts. Cheers hun.  Flat as ... not quite in the basement yet but I feel like I'm heading there. It's Friday night, I should be relaxed and happy. Nothing bad happened today, nothing good either, just feel like I can't be bothered with the world. Feel raw, like my mind has a gravel rash and every thought aggravates it. 
Another two weeks till I see my doc. I am so tempted to starting upping the medication but I know I'd tell someone else not to do that. Might see if I can get an appointment earlier. My doc said last time if the medication isn't effective I'll need to see a psychiatrist who can develop a more complex drug treatment. Hate this. Hate being in the hands of the pharmaceutical companies. I just want the damn things to work! Hiya Tony - thanks mate. I'd settle for a more stable overall mood right now! Things have always pushed my buttons but I used to be a lot better at not letting them explode me. Or at least I'd bounce back quickly if they did. I don't feel I have any defences at the moment. None of the usual protective processes like reasoning or ignoring or dismissing. It's exhausting. Hi Sharny thanks for posting, I'm glad you're here. Have you been through the rapid cycling? More like a rollercoaster than an elevator.  Morning lovely friends. Thank you all for your kindness. Sherie you asked what's changed ...  very good question hun. I don't know really. And it's not just now, it's really what made me suspect there was more to my condition than depression and why I went to the doc initially.  I guess the difference is that I have had to drop right down on the ADs before I started the new drug, which hasn't really kicked in yet, so in some ways I'm not as medicated as I was. I got your hug, thanks lovely, sending one back to you. xx
Tony - yes I'm looking for triggers too. But I don't know if that's it, it's just a cycle I seem to have been in for months. I'm starting to see patterns. Up for a few days, down for a few days, stable for a few days. Thanks for sharing mate.
Hi Carol hun, I'll call today and see what I can do. Feeling pretty good this morning, and I have singing tonight which is fun. Thanks hun.
Hi Sharny - hope you've had a good weekend. Thank you for posting here.
Kaz xx Thanks Paul xx
Tony - it does seem to be chemical in origin as you say. Here's a quote from the Black Dog Institute:
'While we don't yet know exactly what causes bipolar disorder, we do know that it appears to have primarily biological underpinnings. However, its onset is often linked to a stressful life event. And while the causes of bipolar disorder are still unknown, there are a number of factors that are believed to play a role, including genetics, brain chemicals, environmental factors and sometimes medical illnesses. Bipolar disorder is frequently inherited, with genetic factors accounting for approximately 80% of the cause of the condition.'
I'm fairly sure that's the case with me. My doc said it can be genetic and I can see it now in my family.
From other things I've read, it's not unusual for it be diagnosed later in life in people who have already been diagnosed with depression. The thought is that while we go to the doc when we're depressed we don't during the 'ups' provided the hypomania isn't too full on (I have had times when it was, but I was drinking at the time and put it down to that). For me, it was only when the rapid cycling started that I (knowing more about mental illness now than I used to) recognised the symptoms. 
I'm hoping this thread will be a place for other bipolar folks to talk about their experiences if they wish, not just about me, so if there's anyone else out there who would like to join in please do.
A question for fellow bipolars - do you always know when you're 'changing state' so to speak, do you feel it coming on or does it happen suddenly? 
Cheers everyone. xxx Hi Tony. Yes I can see it in my family too, undiagnosed of course. And one of my kids has it, diagnosed 10 years ago apparently, didn't tell me unfortunately.
Thinking about my mum, and my daughter, I realise how fortunate we are to be of a generation that knows about and is starting to accept mental illness. While it's still scary and exhausting, at least we can talk about it, get treatment and help others understand.
Cheers
Kaz Hi Sherie, thanks for checking up on me! You are a treasure. I'm pretty good today thanks, ground floor (that could change on Saturday haha!). I'm learning more and getting better at handling things I think. Still riding the elevator but I'm more alert to what's going on I guess. 
The daughter I mentioned is the one overseas, my eldest, and yes we get on but we don't talk so often. The one you're thinking of is my youngest in Canberra. 
I have met some other people in Canberra who have bipolar and it's wonderful to be able to talk about it with them. I feel very fortunate to have found them. Amazing to hear someone else describe exactly the same things I experience haha.
Aaaaahhh Tony, sorry to hear about things going a bit pear-shaped mate. I know that getting thrown off schedule or having plans changed can be hard to handle. And it is exhausting not being able to escape our heads.
I know you're a long way from home, but are you able to call your doc to talk about the drugs? Might be worth a try. I'm enjoying hearing about your travels - keep it up! 
Cheers my friends
Kaz
  Hi Igbran - thanks for posting here mate, I really appreciate it. Yes we are different ... I'm still learning, but I can see the differences so clearly now that I realise not everyone thinks and feels or reacts like me or does what I do. Don't know how I could have been so unaware for so long. Sigh.
I'm learning to stop making plans (or at least so many big ones) and to try and make my world 'smaller' if you know what I mean. Focus more on the here and now. Moderate is a good word.
I'm really glad to hear your sleeping through. It's a great healer sleep, and in my case devastating if I don't get enough. 
I'm finding my mood diary useful too - I'm still rapid cycling while the medication kicks in, so it's useful to track the cycles.
Re the support group, I just googled bipolar support group Canberra and found it. I hope there's one in your area - I have found it really helpful, especially to be with people you don't have to try and explain it to.
Cheers Igbran - hope to chat again soon.
Kaz  Hi IJG, I'm sorry to hear this has happened! And well done to you for trying to learn and understand your wife's condition. 
Whether and how much her illness has contributed to the breakup might depend on a few things. Do you know if she is type 1 or type 2? Type 1 is far more severe - can cause delusions, loss of touch with reality, seeing things (and situations) that are not there. Type 2 is milder and these things generally don't happen.
Also, is your wife medicated or receiving treatment? And, when the breakup happened was she depressed? Sometimes in a deep depression we can convince ourselves that people would be better off without us.
I agree with Tony that you need to look a bit deeper and not just at the illness, but in saying that I know it does affect how we think. 
My advice would be to just let her know you're still there for her and that you are trying to understand. And learn as much as you can - there are many resources on the internet, just read as much as you can. For info from someone who lives with bipolar, google Natasha Tracy, Bipolar Burble she's an excellent blogger and mental health advocate in the US - best info I've found from a lived experience perspective.
Tony is right that you must take care of yourself. See your doctor, talk to people who understand (including us). You can also call the BB helpline on 1300 22 4636.
Best wishes to you mate and thanks for joining us here.
Kaz  Hiya Len, thank you so much for your posts! It is so helpful to read other people's experiences! 
You have certainly been through the mill, but you seem to be finding a level of acceptance, that's what I felt reading your first post. That really helped me - I am getting there (also 53!) well at least I'm working on it - a work in progress as you say. 
I think my medication is finally kicking in and I'm feeling more stable than I have in quite a while. But I can't take that for granted. I find having to be constantly aware of what's going on in my head and how I'm reacting and behaving with people is exhausting. It's like since becoming aware of having bipolar I've become constantly self-censuring. Everytime I express an opinion or do something, I have to monitor whether I'm going too far - too angry or critical, or too high and over the top. While it means I'm 'managing' my disorder I guess, it also means I've lost that blissful ignorance and spontenaiety. Oh well, that's the way of it eh?
I'm really glad you've found posting here helpful - you are certainly helping others too by doing so. Cheers mate.
Kaz
 
  This bipolar life is giving me a hard time at the moment. After more than a week of feeling stable, normal even, I've sunk again. No obvious reason. I'm fighting the urge to give up everything (except work, no choice there) and hide. I feel like I want to make my world really small. If I had a choice I wouldn't leave the house. 
Anyone else get that? 
Kaz Hi Sherie, you are such a sweetheart. Thank you hun. It's a long process, starting treatment, getting the treatment right, understanding it all. I know you understand that. xx I'll come good again. 
Tony, when I'm down I think I want my world small so I don't have to deal with people or be a certain way. Of course I could cancel everything, make my world small, but I know as soon as I'm 'up' again I'll want to be involved in absolutely everything. That's the way of it.
Len - I'm interested to hear more about DBT if there's anything you can share. Did your psych suggest it? What do you think it will be like?
Cheers everyone
Kaz Thank you Geoff, you're wonderful. 
xx Hi Len - aaahhh, sorry you had such a bad experience driving to the airport mate. That must have been upsetting. And I sure understand the need to sleep afterwards. That's my best treatment after an upsetting and exhausting experience. 
Here's to a better day tomorrow - I hope you can spend it in your garden or somewhere else where you're peaceful and comfortable. 
Sometimes small steps are all we can take Len - but we take them and we keep taking them and that's the main thing. 
Very best to you - talk soon eh?
Kaz Hiya Len and Tony
Len I think you have raised a really important point - sometimes when we're not feeling good it's hard to remember that we're in a better place than we used to be. Looking back to worse times can be reassuring. 
Thanks mate, yes I am in a better place too. I'm super busy at work at the moment and a bit stressed but I'm coping and while I am very tired, I'm OK, and really pleased about that.
I'm really interested to know more about the DBT - hope you'll let us know how it goes.
Tony - my notebook and I are inseparable (I just have to remember to write things in it LOL). I am very fortunate to have a young offsider at work (who knows about my condition) who gently reminds me of things. She's a treasure who, without any judgement, totally accepts that my memory is rubbish and I need some help. I think young people are more accepting of mental health issues than our generation, bless 'em.
Have a good day guys.
Kaz Hi Len, how are you mate? How did the DBT assessment go?
I've had a bad few days, a lot of stress at work triggering anger and frustration and distress. I know when  it's coming and I feel it building but I haven't worked out how to manage it, nor how to manage my mouth. I've said some things I shouldn't have (I was right, but it's not good form in the public service to be direct and honest). I don't cope well with power games or sucking up or control plays that muck other people around, and unfortunately when I see it happening, I call it. Wish I could just shut up. I so wish I could retire but I'm at least five years away from that. 
Part of me wants to be unmedicated and let my mind be whatever it is, but the other part knows that would be a career ending move. Maybe I should be more medicated till I don't feel anything.
Whatever, I think I need to speak with my doc about something to control the frustration. Any suggestions? Has anyone tried PRNs or benzo (I know that's more for anxiety).
Hope you have a good weekend Len.
Cheers all
Kaz Aaahh my lovely friend Sherie. Seeing you has made me smile. Thank you so much hun. A big hug back to you. xx
I haven't seen much of the Olympics - I've been doing long hours at work and coming home and sleeping. I'm so fortunate that I can sleep easily. It's my favourite pasttime at the moment. But I have to say my favourite team at the moment is the Fijian rugby sevens! Even The Pom was happy for them haha.
Sorry I missed the party - I'll try to pop in to the cafe over the weekend. There's so much activity there I can't keep up, but I read when I can.
I see my doc every month because I have to have the lithium levels monitored. I'll talk with her about other medications when I go next, which is soon. I'm also due to start with a psych soon once I get through the busiest time at work and can get time to go. 
I hope all is well with you hun, I'm sorry I've not been able to keep track. Must be getting nice in your part of the world? Still cold here but the wattle's out and a trees are going to blossom soon. Promise of spring!
Hey! What about our Raiders eh! Aren't they doing well!
Love ya hun
Kaz Hi Len, good to hear from you. I didn't realise you were a public servant. Well, you understand then - it does things to people. 
Hey, nothing wrong with a pyjama day when the Olympics are on! That's what we're supposed to do isn't it? UnAustralian not too 😄.
Think it's going to be nice weather tomorrow - maybe a little time outside? Won't be long and we'll be able to lose ourselves in the spring planting Len. Can't wait.
Cheers
Kaz Hi Loula - oh hun, what a horrible experience! Did you go straight onto a high dose of lithium? I started very low and have been gradually building up. I've had some side effects but nothing as bad as you've described. I had brain fog for a while and nausea, and still have a bit of cognitive deficit (mainly poor memory and sometimes loss of words). Were you on lithium before? 
Sounds like a different drug might be best for you - don't give up on medication altogether. Unfortunately it takes time to get the meds right but there are others you and your doctor can try. Your GP might decide to refer you to a psychiatrist and that could be a good idea if you're having trouble with the meds. They are far more expert with medications than GPs (well that's what my GP told me anyways).
Perhaps you can tell your workplace that you are having to take medication (no need to say what for) and that it's affecting you. People take meds for all sorts of things, they don't need to know.
If you haven't already, maybe do some googling on different drugs for bipolar - there's a lot of information out there.
Big hug to you hun
Kaz Hi Loula - from what I read, this is a common question for people with bipolar. But it's the depressive side talking, not the reality. When these thoughts hit, we need to be extra careful and mindful - they can be the precursor to the 'they'd be better off without me' suicidal thoughts.
There is no reason why a bipolar person can't be in a relationship with someone they love and who loves them. That's the reality. We have an illness. But we are still us. Would we think someone who is left disabled after a car crash should leave their partners because the partner 'deserves better'? Or someone diagnosed with diabetes? 
Share your fears and feeling with your husband hun. Let him in. What you're thinking are loving thoughts, but they are misdirected. He loves you. And you are not defined by this illness.
Hugs
Kaz Hi Len, thanks for looking for me mate. I'm not real good at the moment. Think I'm about to be made redundant - I've been told there won't be a job for me once my current project is over. It's a big shock, and I'm not handling it well. 
I'm glad to hear about the DBT - really hope it goes well. Let me know how it progresses eh?
Kaz
xx Hi Confusion, welcome to beyondblue, and a special welcome to this thread. I was diagnosed in May after 15 years of treatment for clinical depression. Like you, I basically knew before the diagnosis, but it still rocked me. All your questions are very familiar to me ... I've turned myself inside out asking how much of me is me and how much is bipolar disorder. 
I also spend a lot of my thoughts now questioning myself - is what I think real or not, do other people think this or is it me being bipolar ... etc etc
Wish I had an answer for you hun, but I haven't worked any of it out yet. I would recommend reading as much as you can though - information is important. There's an excellent blog out of the US called Bipolar Burble by Natasha Tracy - worth a read.
Stick around Confusion, maybe we can work some of this cruel mystery out together.
Kaz Thanks Len and Sherie xxx Thanks Paul - I'm always up for a hug!
If any of my buddies can spare some positive thoughts today I'd be grateful if you send them my way. I have the first meeting about redundancy this afternoon. I'm feeling OK this morning but expect that will change. I was fighting off the anger last night, and I really hope I can get through this in a calm way. 
Love to all
Kaz  I'm fighting the urge to hide and make my world really small again. I got through yesterday's meeting OK, a few tears, but at least I didn't shred anyone. I wanted to, but I am going to need references from these people. 
Today I just want the world to go away and leave me alone. Got to face it though. 
Love to all
Kaz Hi Ozzy, thank you, that's so kind. 
Things have moved quickly since I posted here last. I finish work this Friday. I've had to have some time off since I was told about it, haven't handled it very well and my doctor told me to stay home. I saw my psych yesterday and she was a real help, especially helping me to not take it personally. Now that I've accepted it, I just want it to be over so I can move on. 
Sorry to hear you've been through it too Ozzy. It's crap eh. How did you handle it?
Kaz
  Hi MallowPuff, welcome to the thread mate. It's good to meet you. 
I know what you mean about it making sense - I found that when I was diagnosed, suddenly so much of what what I'd been through in the past fell into place. Quite a revelation. For me it was a mixed blessing, still is really. I finally started to understand why I am like I am and why I've done certain things and thought certain ways. And that was comforting in a way, plus it meant I could get the right medication and treatment (which is going well for me now). And it provided something of an explanation for the times of deep depression for no apparent 'reason'.
But it also brought up a lot of anger and regret - why didn't I know earlier, what might have been different in my life if I'd known. It made me realise that people I'd thought were so wrong in their thinking, times I'd been 'thwarted' with projects that I thought were utterly essential, times I'd pushed people into things because I was so convinced I was right, times I'd reacted badly to small things, flying into a boiling rage ... were my doing, my mistakes, my screwy thinking - bipolar hypomania.
Initially the diagnosis made me extremely cautious - anytime I wanted to do something, anytime I felt good, or angry and frustrated, I analysed myself almost to a standstill. Is this me or this the bipolar? How do I know I'm right, how do I know this is a good idea, am I understanding what that person is saying or interpreting it through a bipolar filter? I started to doubt everything I thought. 
I still self-check a lot of my thinking, but since the treatment has settled in, and I've accepted being bipolar and all that comes with it, I am much better at getting on with life now. 
You are right to read up as much as you can - learning about the condition, especially the lesser-known or publicised aspects of it (the dailyness of it rather than the more dramatic high or low episodes) has really helped me. 
I'm only about six months ahead of you Mallow in terms of learning and accepting the diagnosis, so if there's anything I can share that might be useful, if you have any questions as you come to terms with this, please reach out. It's different for everyone of course, but I'm happy to share my experiences and what I've learned.
Hey - the good news is, even with treatment, the happy highs can still happen. I'm still as silly as I've always been and sometimes that's loads of fun. 😊
Very best to you my bipolar buddy
Cheers
Kaz 
  Hi MallowPuff - I know what you're saying mate. 
First, yes it is possible to be high functioning, hold down a high pressure job etc and be bipolar. I did and I know others who do. 
LIke other mental illnesses, bipolar is on a spectrum. Some of us (especially bipolar 2) have a much milder version than others (especially bipolar 1). There is also a form of bipolar disorder called cyclothymia which is milder still (in which your moods go up and down but you don't get the extreme highs or lows).
As for accepting things we 've done or believed or trouble we caused in the past, I don't have any real answers (I'm working on it with my psych). All I can say is that it's very hard to come to terms with, but somehow we have to aim for a point where we just look forward and try not to stay in the past (yeah, I'm not there yet).
DId you know that studies have shown bipolar people often have higher than average intelligence and are very creative? And do you know that in the majority of cases bipolar is genetic? Our brains just work differently.
I hope this is helpful Mallow. Here anytime if you want to keep talking.
Cheers
Kaz Morning Mallow, hope you slept well.
Yes, we do just keep going - that's the best thing we can do. But we also need to take good care of ourselves. If you've been reading around you've probably seen this but thought I'd mention it anyway ... it's important that we maintain healthy habits that help keep us stable. Eat well, stay hydrated (especially important with mood stabilisers), keep the booze to a minimum, try to get a good sleep routine going, same times each day, and exercise. 
I know how frustrating it is waiting between appointments and waiting for drugs to kick in. Where are you up to with drug treatment? Have you just started? It can take a while, and there might be some side effects (minimal in my case fortunately). 
I found everything seemed to intensify for a while when I started on medication, but it did settle down in time.
Hope your day is a good one mate.
Kaz Hiya Mallow, it's early days mate. I remember thinking the medication wasn't doing anything for me during the first month or so. It was, but as with you, as soon as it wore off I'd be back to the racing thoughts, aggitation etc. It has to build up to a therapeutic level over time. I also found each time the dose was increased I'd get side effects but they only lasted a couple of days then settled.
Hang in there mate, it's worth waiting for. 
The weight gain is a real bugger. I know many bipolar people who have put on weight quickly, and I certainly have. The drugs make me hungry, not just 'oh I feel like a snack' but the actual physical pang of hunger. Not sure what to do about it. Like you I don't want to put weight on (I'm already a woman of substance haha). If you come across any tips, or know anything from being an athlete, I'd be grateful to hear it.
Hope you have a good day today Mallow. Be nice to yourself.
Cheers
Kaz Hiya Mallow, good to know your stressors have settled. I hope it all goes well without medication - I'll be keen to know how it's going. Will you be drug-free then? I'd love that but don't think it's possible for me.
I've had a reminder that I'm still a bit fragile. I started yesterday morning feeling great, then my brand new computer carked it (operating system got stuck in a restart loop) and I lost it. Went into a shaking, crying rage that felt like it would rip me apart. I wanted to throw things and smash things (fortunately I didn't). When I came out of it I went down, flat as a tack and teary. I'm still really flat this morning. 
I'd been going so well, thought I was over the anger of losing my job, but this has set me back. I know I just have to take it back to the shop, but I've got files on there I need and it seems an impossible task to do anything.  I hate the world again, and I hate knowing I'm still fragile.
Kaz Hey Mallow, what a lovely post! Thank you, that did lift my spirits. 😄
And yes I did chuckle at 'switch it off and on again'. I loved the IT Crowd, great show. Well, the great great news it, it seems to have fixed itself. I held the off switch down for about 5 minutes out of desperation and the start up screen came up and a thing that said the update was completed. What bloody update? I neither know nor care but whatever it was it took 24 hours! Anyways, it then started going through its start thingy and next thing I know it's working! And it still is! 
So, I'm still jangled and washed out but very glad I didn't smash it when I wanted to. 
I like your approach Mallow - and yes it is very hard to come off drugs once you've been on them a while. So it's definitely worthwhile finding out if you can get by without them, with help at hand if you can't.
I talked with my psych last time about the 'what's me and what's bipolar'. She helped me see it's all me, just different aspects of me or my mind. It's hard to stop thinking that way though. I don't want to be defined by my condition, yet I see clearly now how it affects me and has in the past. Hard to reconcile sometimes ...
Anyways, eyes front and onwards my friend. We can do this ... whatever this is. 😊
Cheers
Kaz (hug) Hiya Mallow - yep, I'm learning too what an expensive business it is having a wonky brain. Between doctors, psychs, drugs and blood tests I reckon I'm keeping the economy going. 
Hope you had a good day mate despite the lack of funky big magnets. 
Cheers
Kaz
xx I say buy the Harley anyway Mallow 😀 Bipolar or not, we're all entitled to a mid life crisis. I bought a red convertible when I had mine (true - sadly my then husband pranged it). 
You know, being diagnosed doesn't make you any different to what you've always been. It just gives you a context for troubling behavioural things and, in particular, otherwise inexplicable depression. But, I know, there's the label to contend with and all the associated stigma.
Seems to me your main focus now is to see how you get on without medication. Focus on that, don't tie yourself in knots over the diagnosis. I so hope it works for you and wish you every strength mate.
Cheers
Kaz 
  Hiya Len - good to see you mate! How's things? I'd like to hear about these radical diet choices, especially if they work - I really have to Do Something about this weight gain.
 Hi Mallow, hope you're OK today.
Cheers
Kaz Hi Mallow - sorry it's taken a while to reply. I forgot to post that I'll be off the forum for a week or so while my daughter is visiting from overseas. 
Hope you're going OK this week.
Cheers
Kaz  Hiya Len and Mallow - how are you guys? 
Mallow I hope your manflu's gone, terrible thing manflu. Great to hear you're back on your bike Len - are you enjoying it?
I'm in a bit of a hypo state at the moment - head's all over the place wanting to play instead of focussing. Not sleeping, can't settle, racing thoughts ... and I bought seven pairs of shoes yesterday. It made perfect sense at the time (still does) they were all less than half price. But today I realise I probably didn't need them all ... 😊 You know what it's like right?
Anyways, the reason I bought so many shoes (well, my rationale anyways) is that I will need them for my ... wait for it ... NEW JOB!! Yes, I have got me a job, just a casual position at this stage, which is what I wanted because I'll be studying next year. I'm now a mental health peer support worker. How very bloody cool is that! F- the public service, I'm gonna do something I actually care deeply about. Not sure yet when I start, but I can't wait!
Meanwhile, daughter's visit has been interesting. Not as much fun as I'd hoped, but that's the way of it. 
Anyways, hope you are all feeling OK and enjoying the sunshine! 
Cheers
Kaz Hiya Len - thanks mate. It's always good to talk with you. Yes I'm chuffed about the job.
Hahah, I thought you'd understand about the 'retail therapy'. Hey, I know someone who bought the entire contents of a small shop when he was manic, and someone else who bought a boat. At least my shoes fit in the wardrobe. 😄
I'm still a bit jangled tonight - had a meeting this afternoon about something important to me, now of course I'm turning it over and over, reliving it, did I say the right things, why did I say that, why didn't I say this ... exhausting. There's no consequence regardless, so I wish my brain would just shut up for a while.
I'm sad too because my daughter's going back. Sigh.
Glad you've got such good weather Len. Ours is good too at the moment. Perfect gardening weather. Did you have a party for your son? 21 eh? Make you feel old? Haha. My eldest is 30 and youngest 27.
Now about this cycling ... newly trained first aider needs to know - do you know what to do if you're injured? And, did you know you can get an app on your phone that will connect you with the emergency services and provide GPS locational data and such? A good thing if you're going far or riding in unfamiliar places.
Have good night mate, chat soon I hope.
Cheers
Kaz
 
  Hiya Mallow - I'm glad to hear the manflu's gone. I had a dose of it ealier in the year (I'm sure it was your actual manflu, caught from my hubby) and it laid me flatter than flat. Horrible thing.
How are the meds treating you so far? Mine took quite a while to settle, both with efficacy and side effects - worth it once they kick in though.
And how are you feeling about seeing the psych? Hope it goes well and he/she is a good one.
Factory outlet shopping - oooohhhhh. I want. 😄 Sadly, I think I've done my dash with manic shopping for a while. Think hubby's coming with me next time haha.
Thanks for the congrats on the job. I'm still home waiting impatiently for a start date. 
It's hot like almost summer hot today. The rampaging bamboo in my backyard has doubled in height overnight (true!), so time to attack it again.
Have a good day Mallow, you too Len mate.
Cheers
Kaz  So, after the hypo buzz comes the inevitable crash. Sigh. At least it's predictable.  Hi Mallow - I like your style with the runners. Fluro green is excellent. 😄
Just wanted to let you folks know I'm going AWOL for a while. Need to lick some wounds. The job offer has been withdrawn and I'm gobsmacked. 
It was a peer support position with a large NSW-based not-for-profit. They offered it to me about two weeks ago. Then, apparently it had to be processed by their HR people and they decided my degree isn't relevant and I have no experience. Well, that was clear in my application, and at interview, and when it was offered. And qualifications weren't required. No idea why they let it go this far. I suspect their HR didn't like the b word.
Still, if this is their level of professionalism, I'd rather know how they operate now than after committing to them. One off the list.
See you later guys. Take care, and enjoy the runners Mallow.
Kaz
xx
 
  OK, right, well, that made me cry and smile at the same time. 😊
Thanks Kaitoa (and Bundy) - means more than I can say. Big squishy hugs to you too lovely fella and doggie. 
xx Good morning all - so I pop on to see how Mallow's appointment went and here you all are! Goodness! (In every sense.) Thank you so much Kaitoa, Corny,  Wishful, Mallow and Len - what a fine bunch you are. I feel like I've been encircled by kindness. Thank you.
Kaitoa - thanks for the reminder of ethicaljobs.com, a very good site. I'll check it today. Big cuddle for Bundy (and you).
Corny hun - I'm a bit biased about the disclosure thing at the moment. I could just be being paranoid, but I don't think I'll be totally open from now on (I would have thought it wouldn't be a problem for a mental health peer support position ... sigh). 
Wishful my lovely - I intend to find a reason to wear every one of my new shoes! (I do love how you all seem to understand the shoe thing. 😄)
I'm still a bit wobbly but trying to focus on weeding - in my mind every weed I pull out is a nasty, cruel or stupid person that the world could do without. And the really big ones are Donald Trump. 
How's your garden going Len? Is it hot down your way - we've suddenly skipped spring and gone into low 30s. After so much rain, the weeds love it. 
Mallow mate, it sounds like things are progressing as they should. I remember being at your stage, starting to up the dosage and being impatient and thinking it wasn't working properly. Then, suddenly it was. And don't kick yourself about trying to go drug-free. I admire you for testing it - now you have a baseline so to speak that you can compare against. I'd love to go drug-free but like you I need to earn a living and stay married. 
One thing I can tell you is that once you get the dosage right and settled in, you will feel immensely better. It's not a cure of course - I'm still up and down but it's very different going up and down from a regular position of stability than just freewheeling.
Hope the psych appointment goes well today mate.
Love to all
Kaz 
xxxxx Hiya Mallow - how are you today mate? 
I understand why you might feel a bit adrift after your psych appointment. At least you know she's ethical and not just after fees. 
As for what's next, I think that will become apparent. Just live day to day, take notice of how you're feeling and especially notice what triggers you. I kept a mood diary for a few weeks - nothing extensive, just 'up', 'steady', 'down', 'really down' etc - so I could track patterns. When I started on medication I was pretty much on a weekly cycle and by the time I stopped the mood diary I was steady most of the time. 
I think managing stress is really important. Maybe try and build some times into your day to consciously relax and be calm. I haven't really got the hang of mindfulness - I only seem to remember I should practice it when my head hamster is full tilt and I have absolutely no chance haha. I used to find just closing my door, and closing my eyes for a short time helpful during the day. Listening to calming music helps me too.
I guess one way at look at this stage Mallow is that you're not on your own - you have your doc, family and us - but you are now at a point where you need to manage things yourself and try to make them work for you. 
Once we're stable we all have different things we need to focus on (anger for me, perhaps relationship things for you). But we can, and we do. I am so glad to hear things have slowed for you and you're feeling more in control. It's nice when that happens. 😄
Cheers mate.
Kaz
  We have to give MallowPuff credit for that one Kaitoa - it's a beauty eh? Absolutely perfect description of a racing, hypomanic mind. 
So Mallow my mate, you have contributed to the nomenclature of bipolar. Well done. 😄 And I intend to borrow it as if it were your pen.
xx hehehe ... so many pens, so few hands for them to FETH into. Sigh. Oh Corny, you are a sweetheart! Thank you, that's very kind, and I'll never say no to a lead of course! Alcohol rehab is definitely an area I'd like to work in, and addiction treatment and recovery will be included in the studies I'll do next year.
Cheers possum, and big hugs. 
xx How are my bipolar buddies? 
Mallow I hope you haven't melted into mush-mallow in the heat. How's things?
Len are you OK mate? 
And other buddies and friends - hiya!
I'm mostly good at the moment, though I had a lost day today. Not depressed, not even flat, but no energy, fuzzy head and lots of CBA (can't be arsed). I have these days now and then - don't know if I'm just lazy or if the medications zap me out sometimes. 
Do you have days like this when there's nothing wrong but nothing really right either?
Hugs guys
Kaz Ooohhh, I like ice cream! Never had candy cane kind though ... must seek it out. I had a creme caramel tonight. After a sanger for dinner because I CBA cooking. Glad I'm not the only one Kaitoa. And it doesn't cause any harm eh? See, maybe I'm improving. There was a time I'd have been very hard on myself after a day doing nothing. 
Actually, I did do something! I read more of a book I'm wading through - Change your thinking, by Dr Sarah Edelman. Very good and readable CBT textbook - looong though.
Cheers gorgeous
Kaz  Hi MsPurple, welcome! 
Even though hypomania and mania are often used interchangeably, in clinical terms, from what I understand, there is a real difference. Mania is most commonly a symptom of bipolar disorder type 1, the more severe condition, and is differentiated from hypo and bipolar 2, by the pressence of delusions, losing touch with reality and hallucinations - psychotic states. At this stage people often need hospitalisation. People with bipolar 1 experience the symptoms of hypomania too, which can escalate into mania and psychosis.
Hypomania can manifest in some or all of these - highly elevated mood, very high energy and activity, increased risk taking, a tendency to addiction, racing mind, periods of sleeplessness, unrealistic ideas or plans, difficulty concentrating or focussing, overspending, also talking very fast and incessantly.
 In some people too it can take the form of explosive anger, fixating on someone or something that has upset you, rage and tears that are disproportionate to the event that set them off. 
A lot of people know when they're getting hypo, they can feel it building. Your mind becomes kind of fractured and you can't concentrate. It gets busy, racing with impulses to 'play' or talk incessantly. That's a good hypo. For me at least, a bad hypo can come on suddenly, sparked by anger. 
According to the Black Dog Institute there is a 10 percent chance that a child of a bipolar parent will also have bipolar. So there's a 90 percent chance you won't. That said, it is genetic and does seem to run in families.
Can it develop later in life? Yes. At least it is not uncommon for it to be diagnosed later in life, often after years of being treated for something else, most commonly depression. (After all, we are more likely to go to the doctor when we're depressed than when we're feeling unusually up). And it's common for it to be masked by things like addictions (in my case alcoholism). 
Recent theories also suggest that people who have a genetic predisposition might go through life quite normally until it is 'triggered' by a highly stressful event. And a series of stressful events can 'develop' it.
The good news hun is that despite your history, there's every chance you won't develop it. But if you do, it is very treatable with appropriate medication, and good self-care. Talking therapy with a psych that understands bipolar also helps you develop strategies to cope with episodes. 
Hope that helps
Cheers
Kaz 
  Oohhh goody! My fellas are back! Hiya Len and Mallow, and Kaitoa of course - you are always welcome here my friend.
It's helpful to know that CBA is a common thing haha. And I agree with Kaitoa that with all we've been through and go through, no wonder we sometimes CBA. In fact, I think we should take an executive decision that doing nothing occasionally is a valid form of therapy. Hey, there's an idea for a book! 
Len it sounds like you're doing good stuff for yourself mate. Sorry to hear the sun's a bit elusive. We've finally got proper sunshine and heat here and, like you, I love the feel of it on my skin. My war on weeds continues but I'm finally winning. Hubby's been building a path, walls and garden beds so soon I will get to do what he calls 'proper lady gardening' and plant. Can't wait!
Mallow I'm so glad to hear the drugs are working for you. Isn't it a relief when they kick in! Take care though, it's easy when you start feeling so much better and normal to think there's nothing really wrong and decide you don't need them. Aparently a lot of us do that ... and end up suicidal or in hospital or such. (I did that with antidepressants once ... very bad idea.)
So, between us we have one harmonica, nine guitars (I have three, with one amp) and two ukuleles, and I sing. We need a drummer and a bass player. Kaitoa, I know you sing too, do you play? MsPurple? 
Guess we need a song or two as well .... suggestions?
I'll ponder this while I pull out more weeds. Great to see you guys. Take care and enjoy yourselves. 
Kaz
xxxx
  Kaitoa, just read your post again. I think you're spot on. Living with a disorder is exhausting, and people who don't live with a disorder don't understand that. And even we forget sometimes.
I have jokingly said I could sleep for Australia, and I know I'm extremely fortunate that I can sleep, I only have trouble if the head hamster is full tilt, or if I'm really distressed. 
My doctor always tells me to not sleep too much, especially during the day, but I find it healing, especially if I'm depressed. It feels like it gives my mind time to work on stuff without me having to get involved. And anyways, it's nice. An upside of being unemployed. 😄
Cheers

  Hiya Kaitoa - I am an ageing wannabe rock chick my friend. Rock classics from the 70s and 80s, though I also love soul and R&B; 60s style. But basically I like anything as long as it's not crap.
I used to play and sing a lot at uni (ummm, 30 years ago) with assorted friends in bands etc, but grown up life with kids and work etc put an end to that. These days I mainly do a lot of caraoke (singing in the car). My current car obsessions are the original version of Drift Away (can't remember the artist), a few Jimmy Barnes songs from his latest album, and couple of Tom Petty songs (Won't Back Down is my signature tune). My proper karaoke party piece is Born to be Wild haha.
Until recently I sang in a blues and gospel choir (I'm a tenor) but I gave that up because I hated the repertoire (not much blues, lots of Jesus) and the choirmaster was a bit bossy. 
I'm not much of a muso as far as instruments go, I tend to get passionate then lose interest (that's a bipolar thing, so I've learned). I just entertain myself these days.
A BB band sounds like a fine idea, even if it's just virtual (actually that's probably better haha). I love that you can do percussion Kaitoa, and sax! Baker Street it is then!
Len and Mallow - what should we play? What do you like?
Hope everyone has a good day today.
Cheers
Kaz

  Hiya Len - you are a man of good taste I see. I like all those bands too - and not BCR, blerghh. When I was in high school it was compulsory to like either BCR or ABBA. I was ABBA. You also had to choose between Sherbet and Skyhooks. (I was Skyhooks, of course.) Guess it was our country town, hat-and-blazer-convent-school version of gangs haha.
I don't have Netflix unfortunately. I'd like to see the Tom Petty doco. Looove him. Really like the song he did with Stevie Nicks (Stop draggin' my heart around). Hey! A duet! Do you sing Len?
I overdid it yesterday too my friend. Think I've mentioned how much I love the sun on my skin? Yes, well, too much of a good thing yesterday. Not real well last night. Long sleeves, big hat and shade today.
Have a good day today mate. Blow that blues harp baby!
Cheers
Kaz
 
  Dobie Gray! Of course! Thanks Kaitoa Hiya Kaitoa - yep, I reckon we could have a sax solo in that song. No worries. Say, can I join you in Let Me Entertain You? Love that song! 'Gotta get high before you taste the lows', ooohh, been there, done that. 😄
Sounds like you had a good musical upbringing. Love Roy Orbison, I mean, how could you not? 
How's everyone today? More glorious weather here. Hope it's good in your part of the world.
Cheers all
Kaz
xxx Dream Lover. 😄 My fave. What's yours?
This an eclectic repertoire we're getting here. May I throw some Cold Chisel into the mix? I reckon Mallow and Len would be into Cold Chisel. Or ABBA. Or ACDC. (Once did Long Way to the Top at karaoke. Good fun.)
Kaz
xxx Forever Now gets a very big tick from me! Not sure about Blue Bayou, even though this is a virtual band I must admit my falsetto needs work. Ahhh what the hell, I'll give it a go!
Cheers hun
xx Wooo hooo Dottie! You and your piano are so very welcome to join the band. We are not disorderist here (just disorderly) so bipolar's not essential. Anyways, we can teach you that bit if you want to be. LOL. No, don't even think about it.
Wow, this opens up even bigger possibilities for the repertoire! What would you like to play Dottie? 
You know guys, we're gonna need a name soon ... suggestions welcome.
xxxx
  Hi MsPurple, you're very welcome. 
I understand your fear about it being lifelong - yes it is and I will probably be on medication for life. That rocked me when I was diagnosed - until then any time I had a depressive episode I clung to the thought that maybe this was the last time, maybe there wouldn't be any more. Now I know there will be and that's not easy to accept.
For some reason I find it easier to think of it as a chronic illness rather than a 'mental' condition - say like lupus or diabetes or celiac disease. I wonder if that way of thinking might help your mum? Physical chronic illnesses don't carry the stigma, and bipolar is a physical illness of the brain. We need medication (in many cases) or other ongoing treatment, there's no cure and we need to take good care of ourselves, as is the case for people with physical chronic illnesses.
One thing I'd suggest to you hun is that you be very alert to the effects of stress on you as you go through life. I wasn't of course because I didn't know anything, and I walked blindly into (or often created) major stress situations time and time again, and the effects piled up until I cracked. 
It's only now, looking back knowing I'm bipolar that I can see patterns in my thinking and my behaviours - I put myself through so much, same triggers, same reactions, battling toxic people, resorting to booze as a coping mechanism, always willing to take on the world, never learning from one situation to the next, never having the good sense to stay out of the fray so to speak. 
You are well informed and aware, with your family history. I'm not saying limit yourself or your experiences, but do take notice of how things affect you and protect and care for yourself along the way. A good way to be regardless.
Cheers
Kaz
xx Hiya Dottie - Bohemian Rhapsody! Wooaa. Yeah! Hey Kaitoa, how's your soprano mate? No way I can get the high notes, but I can do the rest haha. Yes to Florence too. I'm probably the only person in the world that hasn't heard Sia. Phantom is beyond me I think but it would suit Kaitoa. I'll play triangle through it.
So, with a pianist on board I reckon there's also plenty of Elton John or Billy Joel we could do. Say, if we did Piano Man, Len could do the harmonica! AND he has a cool hat!
Now there's another issue - what to wear! I'll need to buy some new shoes ... sparkly blue boots I reckon.
Cheers hun
Kaz
xxx Hi Ellu! I've seen you around the threads and I'm so glad you've joined us here! (Thanks Kaitoa for making Ellu welcome.)
You are absolutely spot on when you say it never goes away but we can work around it and lead fulfilling lives. That's such a good attitude and it's true and something we must hold on to during the bad times. 
For me, acceptance hasn't been easy. I was diagnosed early this year after being treated for a long time for depression. The hypomanic aspects were masked for many years by drinking - I self-medicated with booze and put my bad, mad behaviour down to that (I've now been sober for 5 years). And, of course, when I felt elated and wildly enthusiastic and generally 'high', I thought that was how life was supposed to be. Couldn't understand why other people didn't agree with me or think the way I did or wanted to do what I wanted. 
Then I started cycling rapidly, over a period of months, and, well, diagnosis. 
I'm now at a point where I'm stable and mostly well, and I've accepted it. In fact, I guess, I've embraced it and become committed to helping other people with serious disorders, especially bipolar.
You know, what your doctor said about fatigue is really interesting. I've not heard that before but it makes sense. I have bipolar 2 so I'm milder than many people, but I also experience fatigue, and often depression, after a big up. I'm prone to crashing straight after an up (although I think that's improving with medication and less stress in my life). I can certainly understand how people with much more severe episodes might take months to recover. 
Like you Ellu, I have had a career and raised a family (daughters aged 30 and 27). I'm trying to start a new career now in mental health and will be studying for basic qualifications next year with the aim of becoming a support worker.
We certainly must not lose hope hun. There's much to be hopeful about! And, while we know the episodes might come and go for the rest of our lives, we also know that we can get through them and live and enjoy the bits in between.
Very best wishes to you Ellu
Kaz
  Hi Ellu - great to see you! Another singer, woo hoo!
Y'know they say that bipolar folks are often creative, and there's quite a few famous creative types - musicians, actor, artists - who have bipolar. We're special haha.
Serious matter - do you and our other bipolar buddies here experience anger (of the explosive variety) as part of the condition? I was reading a blog I like yesterday and the writer mentioned that many people do (I sure do) but that it's not included as a symptom of bipolar in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) which is the official clinical standard for diagnosing and classifying mental health conditions (from the US but used internationally).
Most people responding to the blog said they felt explosive anger was symptomatic, and I've always considered it the 'bad' up, ie angry not elated, hypomania​.
What do others think?
What's prompted this is this morning, in a matter of seconds, I went from a perfectly happy normal mood to screaming and swearing, wanting to smash my phone and computer and yell at the bank when something that should have been an easy process wouldn't work. Fortunately my hubby, who knows my behaviour well, intervened. It'll probably take me the rest of the day to come down now.
Am I just a cranky bugger, or do others experience this?
By the way Ellu - if you're interested in the blog, google Natasha Tracy, Bipolar Burble.​
Love
Kaz
 
  Hi Kaitoa, you're so lovely to ask. I'm not the best mate, I've sunk. It leaves me pretty drained. But I'll come good again. No worries.
Love to you too.
Kaz
xxx Hi Mallow, great to see you mate. 
It's interesting how we start to notice things we would have once ignored. I know what you mean. I feel it now when there's a hypo lurking and I always know when the black dog's heading my way. The anger is the thing I can't always anticipate, and it leaves me so jangled and awash with crap in my head.
I guess it's a good thing that we're alert to changes, but it does mean we're constantly aware and on guard almost. It's exhausting. 
Well done for getting through last night with the kids. I hope you have a great day today with the alpacas (LOL). They are beautiful creatures, and I hope your daughter has a wonderful birthday.
Cheers mate, enjoy the weekend. Potential sunshine here after a few days of rain - just enough to make the weeds grow again. Sigh. 😄
Love
Kaz
xx Hiya Dottie - I love Don't Let me be Misunderstood. That's one for the band!
Thanks for the mention of Demi Lovato - that helped me. I wish they (whoever they are) would recognise anger as a bipolar symptom. Anyways, I'm pleased to report that after a jangled sort of down day yesterday, I'm back again today. 
It's a weird thing ... sometimes, often following an angry flash, I get a day or so where I just feel off colour in my head. Not really depressed, though there's mild waves of it, tired and wanting to sleep, and very jangled intrusive thoughts and old memories that pop in, stir things up, then go again. I describe it as like nausea or an upset stomach but in my head. I want to cry but can't (which is unusual for me, I'm a very good cryer), like wanting to throw up but not being able to ... I don't know if this makes any sense. 
Anyways, a good long sleep usually helps, as does watching a movie or something that engrosses and distracts. Last night I watched Die Hard LOL. First time I've seen it. Bruce Willis saves the world in a singlet. How could you not enjoy that.
Hey Mallow my mate - how were the alpacas?
Love to all here
Kaz 
xx Ooohhh Mallow. Bipolar as, my friend! 😊 Yep, I understand totally. I wish it was the other way around ... bipolar made us reluctant to spend money. That would be something! 
Well, we do our bit for the economy I guess. A bipolar-lead recovery. 
Sounds like you all had a great day for your daughter's birthday. A very busy day though, well done for making it through. Remember to rest. Are you sleeping OK at the moment?
As for just taking the meds and making the most of it, well, yes. BUT, if you feel unwell at any time, either right down or manic, see your doc straightaway. Sometimes we need additional or different medication for a while to get through episodes. Don't just try and struggle though. And post here any time if things don't seem right.
So, new guitar hey? Just right for the band ...😄
Cheers Mallow, take care mate - have you knocked off for Christmas yet?
Kaz Hiya Len - oh that is great news! Yes, enjoy it for all it's worth. 
I'm impressed with the exercise - I gotta get me some of that. Back in the days when I used to go to the gym the rowing machine was my favourite cardio thing. I should go back there, but typically I get passionate about these things for a while then lose interest. Got to do something though, I'm getting more barrel-like by the day.
My hubby has been busy making garden beds for me to fill up, and I've asked for vouchers for Christmas, so after that I'll be constantly in my happy place - Bunnings garden centre. Wooo hooo! 😊
Have you got nice plans for Christmas? Mine will be quiet, with hubby and daughter. Should be nice. I hope you have a lovely time Len and Santa is good to you.
Keep blowing that harp mate.
Cheers
Kaz

  Hiya Dottie - thanks hun, yes I'm much better now. Even survived Christmas shopping yesterday. 
What are you up to for Christmas? Hope it will be full of good cheer.
You're a lovely ray of sunshine here Dottie. I'm so glad you joined us. 
Love

  Hi Tony - wow! I hadn't even noticed. Thanks mate, and happy new year to you. What are you up to?

xxx So, as we clear away the scraps of the year, I thought I'd leave the (possibly) last word to my hero Carrie Fisher. And yes, I'm gutted. Couldn't believe it.
Here are two quotes from her that I love - I hope the second doesn't offend anyone. I laughed my head off.
“One of the things that baffles me (and there are quite a few) is how there can be so much lingering stigma with regards to mental illness, specifically bipolar disorder. In my opinion, living with manic depression takes a tremendous amount of balls. At times, being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you're living with this illness and functioning at all, it's something to be proud of, not ashamed of.
They should issue medals along with the steady stream of medication.”

“I thought I would inaugurate a Bipolar Pride Day. You know, with floats and parades and stuff! On the floats we would get the depressives, and they wouldn’t even have to leave their beds - we’d just roll their beds out of their houses, and they could continue staring off miserably into space. And then for the manics, we’d have the manic marching band, with manics laughing and talking and shopping and f___ing and making bad judgment calls.” 
― Carrie Fisher, Wishful Drinking
RIP Carrie - and medals and parades for us all!
Love
Kaz Hiya Mallow - I'm with you there!
Happy new year to you and yours my friend.
Kaz
xx Hiya Mallow. What now? Well, I'm not that much further down the track than you are - but I can tell you what I've learned so far.
I think the key thing is acceptance, and that took me a while to get to. Acceptance of the past as well as the present. Once I was diagnosed and started learning about bipolar, I went back over so much in my life and resented that I hadn't known. But I've reached a point where I'm reconciled with it and try not to ruminate. I think that just comes with time. Keep looking forward.
Next I think is self-awareness. Really noticing how you're feeling and whether something has influenced that. Get to know your triggers and ways to avoid or manage them.
I found learning as much as I can helpful, but that's me. Others I know just want to be guided by their doc and 'go with the flow'. But I'm still reading everything I can lay my hands on - I'm determined to manage and live with this myself (with my doctor and drugs of course).
One thing I have noticed though is that a lot of the reading is 'clinicalised' - ie it focuses on what happens in episodes. It describes episodes lasting from days to months, then there being months or years between episodes. And that's to be expected for clinicians who have to treat the more extreme symptoms that present in episodes.
But a lot of it doesn't focus on the dailyness of living with bipolar. For example, the fact that our heads can feel 'out of kilter' day to day without there being a full-on episode happening. The daily battle with fatigue, memory problems, difficulty making decisions, mild depression, or mild hypomanic symptoms like impulse buying or being easily distracted. I've found 'lived experience' blogs helpful. (Google Natasha Tracey).
So, I think one of the most useful things I've done is to accept that it is a daily situation. In doing that, I've given myself permission to 'go with it' rather than fight. If I have to cancel something I do. If I need to sleep I sleep. That's easy at the moment when I'm not working and when I am I'll need to change strategies and make the most of my home time for self-care.
I think you're doing all the right stuff Mallow. Just be self-aware now you're back at work that you might need to approach things diffently - avoid conflict and stress as much as you can, rest as much as you can, but otherwise just live your life. Be kind to yourself - bipolar 2 is a manageable chronic illness, no more, no less in my view.
Very best wishes mate
Kaz 
 
  Hiya Len, good to hear from you mate. Wow, you must getting fit! Good on you. I need to get me some of that fitness thing ... but I still struggle a lot with fatigue. And I am lazy, I know that. It's not just a bipolar thing.
Now, about these medications ... what's the reason you'd like to get off them? Are you having side effects? Or just hate being medicated? Either way I understand, it's crap feeling like we're chemically controlled. However,  my view (and it is just mine for me) is that I'm chemically controlled either way. Without drugs, my brain chemistry is pretty stuffed and does bad things to me. With drugs, it's much better. Simples. That's the rational argument. But I still get the other argument (be free my wayward mind) lodging itself in my thoughts from time to time. 
How's your garden going? I am very pleased to report that my front yard of rocks, pebbles, weeds and spiky things has been transformed into a very pretty cottage garden in the making. I've kept Bunnings and local nurseries in business recently and now we just need to turf in autumn and we're done. Love it. My happy place.
Glad to hear the acceptance is growing (take a look at what I posted to Mallow, it might be useful to you too).
Best wishes to you mate, hope to talk soon.
Kaz  Hiya Dottie, you are always welcome here sweet pea! I love your cheery visits. How are you? 
Len - I wish I'd written this:
My diagnosis, the right meds, family and medical support and not throwing the towel in have made me what I am today. Self care is a big thing and a continual learning process.
Nailed it my friend. 
Your gardening sounds great - you're far more advanced than I am. Once I get all my gardens established I want to learn about worm farming, composting etc. I have a large area marked out for a veggie garden, so I'm hoping to eventually grow lots. There's nothing quite as good as homegrown veggies. I have another area marked out for fruit trees too, so I'll need to learn about managing them and keeping the birdies off when they're fruiting.
My cottage garden sort of encircles the front yard, with a path through to the front porch. It is now full of roses, lavendars, dianthus, dahlias, carnations, a magnolia, margurite daisies, african daisies, penestmons, petunias, verbena and other pretty things I don't know the names of (Bunnings $2 pots). Makes me happier than happy to see them, water them, talk to them (yes I do). 
Couldn't have done any of it without my fella - he did all the stone wall building, shifting dirt, levelling, building the path etc. I just chose the plants and did the planting (what he calls 'lady gardening' haha). The last thing we'll need to do is lay turf on the large area in the middle, but we won't do that until it's cooler, probably March.  It's been a wonderful project to do together while I'm not working.
Next week we start on the back yard - a massive task with lots of ground work involved. Eventually it will be lawn, trees (already have some beautiful mature autumn trees) and evergreen shrubs and a pebble path to the veggie garden. I think of it as our park (It's quite large for a suburban block).
Are you still awake? Haha. Sorry, I do love a chance to rabbit on about my garden. Plants are my favourite people, present company excepted of course.
Cheers mate, hope you have a good day.
Kaz 
  Hiya Dottie - I'm sorry you're feeling bluey grey - wanna chat? We all know bluey grey. Here if you want hun.
Also, cyclamens are good small indoor plants. Very pretty and long lasting if you water them.
Love to you possum.
Kaz  Hiya Mallow. What you've described about acceptance and self-awareness was me six months ago. It's a process, and you will, or won't accept things in your own time. But you will, I hope, come to a point of understanding what's right for you. Take your time. 
I feel like I was living in a delusional bubble and now I'm not. The realisation of it at 53 is irksome, and I still struggle with how could things have been different if I'd known - especially concerning the alcohol addiction. But, then again, things happen for a reason. I met my now hubby during recovery, and I wouldn't have that any other way.
I'll check out that article you mentioned, thanks for that.
Nice work with the veggie garden - I love homegrown tomatoes and lettuces. So much nicer than the supermarket types. 
Take care mate and have a good weekend.
Cheers
Kaz
  Morning Len - hope all is well for you today. 
Interesting what you say about always being addicted to something. Yes, tis in our nature sadly, we are far more prone to addiction than most people apparently. 
So yeah, me too, though not good things like exercise and food unfortuately. Booze and cigarettes for me. I sorted the booze situation over five years ago, but do you think I can get rid of the fags? Still trying, I have little successes, go a few weeks, then something happens and I'm back on them. Sigh. And they're so bloody expensive! 
Maybe that will be this year's recovery project. 
Right, I'm off to the still-weedy back yard, with destruction in mind.
Cheers mate, have a good weekend.
Kaz  Hiya Dottie - no I haven't read An Unquiet Mind, but I've certainly heard of it. Thanks for the reminder, I'll put it on my list. I've just started The Happiness Trap - it's excellent.
Must admit though, I feel like I'm reaching saturation point with MH-related things at the moment. Think I need a rollicking good yarn with nothing to do with MH for a while. A spy novel, or Dan Brown, or somesuch. Or a good movie - might watch Sean of the Dead or This is Spinal Tap again. LOL. Then there's Spongebob Squarepants. Love him. (Who lives in a pineapple under the sea ...)
Recommendations welcome. What are everyone's go-to movies, books, TV shows etc for a break from our heads?
Hope you're all well and good today.
Cheers
Kaz  Peace, love and mung beans! Oh Mallow you dippy hippy, I haven't heard that for a long time! 😄
Hi everyone, sorry I went AWOL for a few days. Hit a bump. My sleeping got all messed up and I sunk for a bit, needed rest, but I'm back on track, all shiny again. 
Mallow - well done mate for getting through the panic at work. Gee that's hard. I used to find work the hardest place to regain control when I had a bit of a spin. Lost it a few times. And yes, doesn't it feel good when you can focus and concentrate! Enjoy your reading my friend.
I switched off with a Dan Brown (Da Vinci Code) novel, and Big Bash cricket.
Hiya Dottie hun - that quote you posted reminded me of a line from a very favourite song ... 'when I'm feeling blue, the guitar's coming through to soothe me' ... come on, name that tune. 😄
Hey Len - how's it going my friend? Are you surviving the heat OK? It's been fierce here. My little plants are OK though, actually growing which is reassuring.
Love to all
Kaz
xxx Morning Mallow! Congrats on the work audit mate! Yay! I knew you'd nail it 😊
Yes, terrible events in Melbourne. I can't imagine how terrifying it must have been. My heart is heavy for the families and all who witnessed it. Do you live in Melbourne or are you from there? Must be even so much sadder when it's your own city. 
Weekend my friend. What are your plans? My hubby's going off doing motorcyclist things, so I'm left to play on my own, that's dangerous. Haha. I feel a Bunnings outing coming on.
Cheers mate, keep smiling eh? 
Kaz  Hiya Mallow! Good to see you. Glad you had a good weekend and things are going well with the missus. (Don't forget flowers ... they can work wonders 😉).
Mine was good too, or at least not bad - I'm trying to remember what I did ... not much apparently. It was hot and there was cricket.
Yeah, the sleep thing's important. They (the 'experts') say a regular pattern for going to bed and getting up helps with stability. My trouble is I sleep too much - I'm always up very early, before 6, but I need a nap in the afternoon. Then bedtime is about 10. I like sleep. Think if I start working again I'll need to take a camp bed with me, and put a sign on the office door 'do not disturb the bipolar bear'.
I had a lovely day today. I've started volunteering as a social companion for people with mental illness, and I met my first 'buddy' today. Really lovely woman about my age, we have a lot in common and we 'clicked'. Looking forward to getting out and about with her. We're going swimming next week. 
Other than that, things have been quiet for me. I've been a bit inwards, but not in a bad way, just reflective and maybe a bit self-absorbed. I'm waiting on some news which I won't jinx by saying what it is. Let's just say this week will require patience, not my strong point.
I've been trying to avoid TV and social media as much as possible too. I tend to want to throw things when a certain orange-faced blight on the free world pops up.
High maintenance? We're all high maintenance mate ... and we're worth it, every bit. 😄
Cheers
Kaz  Morning Len - your cruise sounds exciting, where are you off to?
I'm with you on the collective hug and pat on the back. We're all going pretty well at the moment eh? 😊
It's so good to have fellow travellers on this strange and rocky road.
Morning Mallow - hope you have a good day at work mate.
Hiya Dottie - how's our little ray of sunshine today?
And hi Tony - how's things my friend?
If there are any newcomers or lurkers out there who want to join in with our little crew, please feel free to post. You will be very welcome.
Another hot one in the capital today. Quiet domestic day for me I think.
Cheers all

  Hiya Ivan - welcome mate, glad you found us. Sorry I wasn't here when you posted, I've had a busy couple of days. Hi everyone else too!
Ivan - that's a hard choice to make, between a rock and a hard place so to speak. As I think I told you elsewhere, I've been on a mood stabiliser for about 9 months and I'm not sure I could manage without it. But I sure understand the desire to be medication free. And I know the awfulness of constant brain fog (which I had when I started on meds, along with other side effects).
I think it's a matter of what works best for you and what you are prepared to live with. It's entirely your choice, which only you can make in the context of what you need to do and be in your daily life.
Anyways, by way of introduction, this thread is a place to chat with fellow bipolars and friends - about being bipolar and about pretty much anything else really. We support each other and we have some fun and silliness too (as you'll see if you read back a bit - we even have a virtual band).
I'm sure the other regulars will introduce themselves. I'll kick it off - I'm Kaz, 53, live in Canberra. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about 9 months ago after being treated with depression for 15 years. I'm also a non-practicing alcoholic, sober nearly 6 years. After the shock of the diagnosis settled, I was relieved to realise there was a reason for so many things I'd never understood about myself (including addiction) - too many to name really. I'm still learning, about the disorder and about me. Guess it's a lifelong thing.
When were you diagnosed Ivan? If there's any experiences or thoughts you want to share, feel free. Whatever you're comfortable with.
I hope everyone here had a good Aussie Day - mine has been quiet, just the usual garden, cricket etc. Barbie tonight and then a get together with my daughter tomorrow. 
What's everyone else been up to?
Cheers
Kaz
xx
  Hiya Dottie, Len, Mallow, Tony and everyone else. Ivan I hope you're lurking about. 😄
I have news! BIG news! Two lots of news! The first is that I got a scholarship to do the basic qualification to work in mental health support. Yay! The second is I got me a job! An excellent job even! Both are part time and the hours work out, so from the week after next I'll be studying and working ... eeeeep! No more afternoon naps sadly. 
The job is a 12 month contract in the mental health sector, working on a project for a mental health learning centre - and the best bit is every aspect of the proposed centre will be designed in partnership by professionals AND people with lived experience. The role of lived experience is central to the whole concept. It's still at concept stage, subject to funding etc etc - but what a fantastic thing! I could have done with a place like that 12 months ago.
I'm of course beside myself with glee and have celebrated with much ice cream. 
Going to be busy ... wonder if I can take a camp bed in for my naps. 😄
Cheers lovelies
Kaz Hello velvetfaerie, thank you! How very lovely of you to pop in. Would you like to join us here? It would be great to know you.
I can see you're another ice cream fan. Let's have one together! What's your favourite?
Cheers
Kaz Gym class?  I'm impressed. I did one of those once. 😄
Actually, I used to like going to the gym, especially boxing classes, but as with quite a few things for me, I lost interest eventually. Keep thinking I should go back. But then I keep thinking I should do lots of things. Sadly, great enthusiasm followed by loss of interest is a known bipolar trait and one I've got. At least I now know I'm not just fickle and uncommitted, there's a reason. 
OK velvetfaerie, I'll wait till gym's over to share a cookies and cream ice cream with you. 😊
Cheers
Kaz  Hey Ivan - your second post must have arrived after mine, or maybe I just got carried away with myself. Anyways, I've just seen it. 
Wow, you have really taken things in hand eh? That's fantastic. They say exercise is very important, sadly it's not one of my 'things', though maybe I should try harder. I know Len and Mallow are keen on exercising when they can.
You're doing all the right stuff mate, all the self-care recommended for us. How's your sleeping pattern?
I'm impressed that you've got a handle on mindfullness. I'm still working on that. My head hamster (racing thoughts) often works against being mindful. Any tips?
You seem to have a reconciled kind of co-existence, detante of sorts, with your voice? Have I interpreted that right or does it cause you frequent distress? 
I know you're coming out of a bad patch mate - so I wish you every strength and a stable peace to come.
Cheers
Kaz 
  Thank you Matt - peace to you too lovely friend.
Kaz
xx Hi Resilience, welcome! I'm so pleased you joined us here. And a big virtual hug to you.
I think you're amazing. To cope with having a very sick child and three other teenagers, on your own, is more than enough for anyone to deal with, let alone someone managing their own difficult and unpredictable disorder. I know you're struggling hun, but please just think about that for a moment - what an incredible thing you are doing!
We often say here 'you are stronger than you know', and I reckon you are a gold star example of that.
I'm so sorry about your son, that must be devastating for all the family. As a mum of two, I can only imagine the pain you're in. How is your son coping? And his siblings - brothers or sisters?
Resilience, I know the drinking is troubling you, we spoke on the other thread. All I'd say here is don't let it add to your struggles. If it's causing you grief then try hard to stop or cut down, or at least be aware of whether it's increasing. When you're ready you will stop. That time will come, just be aware that sometimes it doesn't comes till we hit rock bottom, and that's never good. So maybe try to keep it in check, and make sure you're safe when you are drinking. It took me about a year of attempts to finally manage it (after a drunken attempt to end it all).
This thread is a place for we bipolar folks to look after each other - give and receive support when we need it, and also share some lighter times and things we enjoy. If you read back you'll see us chatting about music, gardens, travel plans, ummmmm spending sprees (not so good), sports etc. In my view this is not idle chatter, it's really important for folks battling the rollercoaster and the black dog to maintain our 'normal' interests and talk about them - it gets us out of our heads for a moment and can make us smile, that's always a good thing.
I know your time is probably fully occupied, but what things do you enjoy when you can? 
I'm looking forward to getting to know you better hun. Post when you can.
Cheers
Kaz 
 
  Hi Lady_Stardust - what a beautiful name! Welcome to our little gang. It's lovely to meet you - sorry you're feeling a bit off colour and hope you feel better soon.
I know what you mean about the down times hitting harder because you live in hope you'll stay level all the time. I had a similar but different thing when I was diagnosed. I'd been treated for depression for a long time and with each depressive episode I hoped it would be the last ... maybe mine was one of those depressions that disappear eventually. Once I was diagnosed bipolar I knew it was forever and my heart sank. But, we learn to adapt don't we.
It's great you're stable at the moment, I am mostly too - a vast difference to a year ago.
Best of luck finding a job - what sort of work would you like to do?
What do you enjoy doing in your free time? Any hobbies?
Cheers hun, hope to chat soon.
Kaz 
  Hiya Len - how are you mate? Hope all is well today.
Len a very good friend of mine, our Rainbow Champion Paul, is looking at starting DBT and is interested in hearing other people's experiences of it - I wonder if you might like to share yours (only if you want) on his thread?
He has posted a new thread in the Depression board 'DBT, Borderline and my whole world changing'. 
Thanks mate - and no worries if you don't.
Cheers
Kaz  Party? I want a party! Can I come Dottie? 😄 Have a good time sweat pea. Tell us stories when you come home. (And thanks for the congrats hun - yes, I'm stoked.) BTW, I know you know you're an important part of our little community, but so's you know I understand when you explain you don't have bipolar - I'm a straight supporter in the LGBTI community. Same but different, and valued for who you are and what we share. xx
Hi Lady Stardust - I see you have excellent taste in music. Good musical taste is a common trait on this thread. 😄 I relate to English being your best subject - always was mine too. I'm an ex-journalist by trade, and former communications person in the public service - so I have made my living through writing, one way or another, for 30 years.
Great to see you again.
Cheers to all - isn't it hot again!
Kaz  Morning all - happy Monday! Well, I hope so anyways. 
Resilience - what a most fantastic song!! I recommend everyone listen (see Resilience's post above) it's excellent. 'I've gotten better, at getting better'. Yes indeedy! 
Lady Stardust - hope you're feeling better today hun. And good luck with the huntin'. 
How was the party Dottie? Did you bring us back some lolly bags? 😊
Hiya Ivan - country resort! That sounds like my kinda thing, how lovely. Enjoy the gym.
Len buddy - did you watch the tennis? What a match! I was happy Federer won, but either deserved it really.
How was the weekend Mallow? Hope things are a bit easier at work now you've got through your audit.
Hiya too to Matt, Tony, velvetfaerie and anyone else looking in. I hope you all have a good day today, and know that we're here if you want to pop in.
A quiet day keeping cool at my place today - 39 degrees expected. Must give my garden a good drink before the real heat sets in. All my little plants are growing well, pretty as a picture. Now that makes me happy.
Love to all
Kaz 
  Morning all
Len - thanks for the info on DBT. I'm glad it's going well for you.
Lady Stardust - hope all is well at home. It's always unsettling when there's tension in the house, and I think we can be very sensitive to it. 
Wow Chae, you have great self-care happening hun. Wish I could do that.
So, I start my new job next Monday and I'm getting quite scared and anxious. Part of me knows I'll be fine and part of me is going aaarrrrrgggghhhh! My head hamster is running his little legs off. Nothing to do but do it I guess. Gonna be a long week.
Cheers all, hope you have a good day today.
Kaz
xx Morning all
No worries about the double post Dottie, it just makes it twice as good!
Mallow mate - the one good thing we know about these periods of flatness is that they will pass. Hope yours does soon my friend.
Have to say I'm tickled pink about our lovely place here. Thank you to everyone for being here and helping us all know we're not alone with this thing. I learn so much from others here and enjoy your friendship more than I can say.
Love to all, hope today is good to you.
Kaz Hiya Len - thanks mate. Wonder what piece of furniture I should be ... think I'll be a tall and elegant bookcase. That works for me. 👍
Hope you sleep well my friend.
Cheers
Kaz  Morning all xx
I start school today!! Orientation session for the MH Cert 4 course this afternoon. I'm so excited, like a little kid haha. 
There's a very good chance I'll be the oldest in the class by a long shot but I don't care. It's possible too that a friend from my bipolar support group will be there. I know she was planning to enrol. I hope so, then I'll have a little friend to play with at recess.
This is a big deal - I haven't set foot inside a classroom or lecture theatre for more than 30 years. Most importantly, what should I wear!!! 😄
Hope everyone has a good day, and thanks again for all your support and good wishes with my change of direction. I start work next Monday, so I'll probably be a mess of nerves then too.
Cheers
Kaz
xx I'm tickled pink to be one of your weird people Mallow! Well done on the run too mate! Fantastic - and I know the BB people would have been pleased you stopped by.
Chae - I replied on your other post hun. It's best with something specific like that to start a thread, like you did, because it will be more visible. BUT, feel free to post about anything here. This thread is just a place for us to gather - we can share and seek support about anything. Anyways, I'll repeat what I said - you deserve better and are worth so much more IMHO.
Hi to everyone, I'm a bit tired so won't stay, just wanted to check in. School was good and my friend was there, so I had someone to sit next to. This class is just for the scholarship holders, ie people with lived experience, so I'm looking forward to getting to know the others. I couldn't have an afternoon nap like I'm used to though. ☹️ Early night.
Cheers everyone
Kaz
xxx Hi everyone! Just a quick post - I have to get ready for work!! 😄
Hi Ivan - gaahh, sorry you're in a pit mate. We all know what that feels like - crap. Keep looking up, you'll find the ladder in time. Meanwhile, we're here, sitting with you. Has anything in particular sent you down, or do you think it's one of those truly crap mood swings that happen for no apparent reason?
Hiya Dottie hun - sadly yesterday's afternoon nap gave way to four hours of ironing, my least favourite thing to do. But at least I'm organised. Anxious as hell, but I'll look good haha.
Gotta go - love to all, I hope you have a good day and a cool breeze blows through your hair. 
Cheers
Kaz
xx
  Morning folks
Sorry to hear you're not sleeping Chae, that sucks. I hope you get some peace soon and the bf situation has changed for the better, one way or another.
Hiya Dottie - thanks for asking about me hun. Work was excellent, but I came home absolutely exhausted, and with the head hamster in overdrive. I think I'm going to really enjoy it but getting back into the routine is going to take some getting used to. 
Hey Ivan - how are you today mate? Hope you're emerging from that pit. 
Hope everyone else is well and good.
I think I'll be a bit steamrollered this week, so if I'm not around don't worry, I'll probably just be collapsed on the couch unable to string words together LOL. It's all good though.
Love to all
Kaz
xx Morning all - just popping in to say hi and let you know I'm thinking of you. 
Sorry I've been absent - life's become hectic while I'm settling in to work and school, and sadly we had a bereavement in the family recently. 
I'm looking forward to the weekend and some free time to catch up with everyone. Take care of yourselves, see you soon.
Love
Kaz Morning everyone! I'm awake and alert at a ridiculous hour after much sleep yesterday. I just got back from a  two-day conference in Sydney for work. It was excellent, but a tad overwhelming for my 'new kid' brain I must admit. Even my head hamster is exhausted. 
One thing I can report is that the community mental health sector is full of wonderful people who truly care about what they are doing, and many have their own reasons for being there - lived experience, family experience etc, or just genuine compassion and care. So I feel like I have landed in the right place. I also met some lovely fellow bipolar folks - it was amazing to be in a place where no one hid their illnesses or experiences.
I see we've had some struggles happening here - waterworks, crankiness, not sleeping. Sorry to hear that my friends and I hope everyone's feeling a bit better this fine Sunday. It's just the way of things for us hey? At least we know things can be good too, and time will see us happy again. Meanwhile, we have us - this fine band of buddies.
See you again soon 
Kaz
xxx Morning all, thanks for the lovely responses. I am truly enjoying my work and study, but it is taking the time and energy out of me. 
Chae - being alone isn't a bad thing. I expect you are very good company. But, you do have it in you to change the situation if you want to. Join stuff, volunteer etc. Does it bother you being alone? I like my alone time ... But I do get up to mischief if left alone too long. 
Hiya Dottie - how's things hun? Hope the studies etc are going well.
Hi Lady S - sorry there's no good news about jobs, and taking a break from hunting is a good idea I reckon. It will happen hun, in it's own annoyingly good time.
Hi to everyone else too - how's things Len and Mallow?
Cheers all
Kaz  Hi lovely Chae - a big sisterly cuddle for you possum. I'm sorry you're hurting so much. it really sucks to go through something like that. Sometimes our best qualities can hurt us, tis true. But they are also what make us good people, and that's important to hold on to. You're not stupid hun, you are a good, kind and loving person with all the fine qualities that we seek and admire in others. And the world needs more of you. I know this probably sounds a bit trite right now, but it is also true - this too shall pass. And you will be better off for the new start that will come. Xx
Hiya Dottie! I'd love a coffee thanks. Just about to watch Mardi Gras on the tele. I've had a lovely weekend - family, rest, garden, rest, shopping, pancakes and a new bright orange handbag. 😀 How's yours been hun? Hope you've had some fun.
Hey Lady S - how are you today? Sorry to hear about your family issues and I hope things have improved for you. Families are such a worry sometimes. And don't worry about posting about them here. That's what this thread's for - to share the dailyness of our travels with this thing.
Len mate - sorry I haven't responded earlier. Hope things have settled again for you. IT's such a cruel trade off isn't it. Get the medication right to ward off mania and feel bombed out, or reduce the dosage to stop feeling bombed about and get beset by mania. Not fair. Just stay safe my friend, that's the main thing hey?
Where's our Mallow? In case you're reading Mr Puff, you are missed. 🙃
Big hugs to you all

  Morning Chae - mums know best hun, well, except when they don't, but it sounds to me like your mum's right. You were in an unworkable situation in that relationship in my opinion. There's big heaps of pain now, but I really do believe you'll be better off long term. Hold tight.
Hi to everyone - I've been up for ages and it's only six o'clock. A little lesson in being mindful when taking medication. I took an AD last night thinking it was another drug I was meant to take, consequently ... mildly manic. Woke up every hour and had vivid dreams for the rest of it. Fortunately it's a low dose. Ah well, I'll make the most of it and do some school work before work. Probably crash tonight. Such is this bipolar life.
Hope everyone has a good day.
Kaz
xx Hey Mallow! How good to see you my friend. Great post mate, sounds like you're doing well in this rocky long distance run. So good to hear things are going well with the missus. I think you've come a long way even just in the time I've known you. 
Morning all - hope it's an OK day for everyone. How are you feeling today Chae?
I've had a tough couple of days. One of my classes is on alcohol and other drugs and we had a guest speaker who talked about her experiences as an addict. Part of her story, about the effects on her family and friends, really triggered me and I didn't expect it. (For those who don't know I'm nearly six years sober after a long battle with the booze). It sent me back into the shame and despair of alcoholism and I sunk right down. But, I'm pleased to say, today I feel I'm surfacing again. 
Guess it's all learning hey? It's easy when things are going well to forget that triggers are out there and they can take us by surprise. And sometimes we just have to ride them out. 
Does anyone else experience that? Things that can trigger you when you're not looking?
Cheers all, take care out there. 
Kaz
xx Hiya Mallow - glad you had a good day at work. Gee that makes a difference hey? Do you know about cognitive dissonance? The insidious stress that comes from constantly doing something you don't want to do or can't believe in or agree with. That was me in the public service. The difference now I'm doing something I care about is amazing. And good days at work make a huge difference to us having good days generally. 
And yes, I'm a great believer in modern medicine too 😀. I know medication doesn't suit everyone, and some people want to live drug-free - that's their choice and theirs alone. But it works for me.
How's everyone this fine Saturday? Dottie I'm sorry to read you're sad sweetie. Anything you want to talk about? You're such a beautiful friend and supporter to everyone else, please know we're here for you.
It's a long weekend in Canberra - woo hoo! So, I think it should be for everyone here. I'm taking an executive decision to declare it a long weekend for all of us. I'll write a note for your bosses, tutors, partners, whomever if you want. 😀
Hope everyone has a peaceful time today.
Love
Kaz  Morning all
Hi Chae - hope your head hamster has settled down. Sorry to hear about the anxiety flaring up - a better day today hun.
How's everyone else? 
I'm home today, not feeling great. I've been off colour for a couple of days - suspect a bit of mild toxicity, but can't be sure. Had a blood test this morning, so we'll see. I'm not too bad in the head but can't face being out in the world. Quiet day at home, maybe catch up on some study if the hamster complies (she's currently swimming in wet concrete if you know what I mean - slow, thick and sludgy).
Hope you are all OK. 
I invited a new member OberonX to join us. A big welcome to you Oberon if you pop in.
Kaz  To which I shall add some Tom Petty:
Well I won't back down, no I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down. 
 And Leonard Cohen:
Ring out the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in every thing
That's where the light gets in.
Hey lovely Lady S - a big hug from me too. I'm sorry you're feeling so low. It's the illness making you feel this way hun. Don't let it win, don't back down. Look for that light. You have seven gazillion reasons to be here on this earth, it's just sometimes they are hard to see in the dark. The light will come again, and meanwhile, we're here shining a torch for you.
If these feelings persist Lady S, think about calling our helpline on 1300 22 4636 - it's a 24/7 service staffed by professionals, and they really can help. There's also Lifeline of course on 13 11 14. No shame in reaching out for immediate help. Much love to you lovely lady.
Chae - are you OK hun? Maybe our helpline might be the go for you too if you're having trouble getting to your psych? Take care possum, and talk it out here if you want.
Mallow - nice one my friend. Music always helps me too. 😀
Take care everyone and remember - THIS TOO SHALL PASS.
Kaz
xx Hi folks 
Chae - a big hug for you, you sound like you're in a world of pain. I'm sorry things are bad for you right now. Did you call the hotline? 
Trying to get things done when we're unwell, and especially with physical pain on top can be self-defeating and just continues the spiral of distress. Are you able to just let the tasks go for now, allow yourself to rest and be slow until you're feeling better? It's no different to a physical illness - sometimes we just have to give in and let it run its course.
And even though you feelings of hopelessness are very real to you (we all know them), you are not hopeless or pointless. And while we can't be physically there to hug you or hold your hand, you know we are here and you are not alone.
Be kind to yourself hun and take the time you need - the world, with it's flawed systems, will still be here when you're better and stronger. If you want to vent about the mental health system, feel free. I see it from the inside these days and there is much to vent about!
Hey beautiful Dottie - I'm so sad that you're suffering. Just doesn't seem fair when you are such a ray of light and love on this forum. I'm very relieved to hear you resisted SH, but also disturbed that you feel so bad that it became an option. 
What support do you have in your daily life hun? Anyone you can talk to? Feel free to unload here if you want to - sometimes 'unpacking' what's happening in our heads can help us get a bit more clarity. AND, if the thoughts of SH return, you know what to do - get to your doctor, call our helpline, call Lifeline - you don't have to go through it alone.
I hope all my other shipmates here are having a good weekend. We've hit some troubled waters for some of the crew, but we'll get through, we always do. Keep looking up folks - there's hope ahead.
Love to all
Kaz

  Hi Chae - I'm sorry to hear you ended up in emergency, but so glad you've had help and treatment and you're on the mend. I don't get migraines but I know they can be absolutely crippling.
Yes, it's easy to forget those fun things in our busy lives isn't it, but they're essential for our wellbeing and without being well we can't do much else! Enjoy your music, lose yourself in it, rest, repair, regroup. And try to take it bit by little bit for a while hey? 
I'm glad you called the helpline - great folks. And thanks for letting us know - it's really good for others to hear that calling the line has been helpful for someone else.
I hope your day is peaceful and without pain hun.
Kaz Morning all - I'm up at stupid o'clock again. Don't know why. Oh well, gives me some time here. 
Hiya Mallow, hope you slept well despite your resistance. I know that feeling of not wanting to sleep on Sunday night because it makes Monday morning come quicker. 😀 Have a good day my friend.
Len! So good to see you back on dry land. Sorry you had some rough times. I think being out of our usual routine and comfortable space can upset the balance sometimes. I'm not real fond of being away from home these days. Hope the bits you did enjoy were truly special.
Hi to all our lovely folk - here's to a good week ahead hey? Mine started yesterday with a massive win by the Canberra Raiders (rugby league) and tonight I'm going to the Canberra Comedy Festival with my gal for her birthday. I have a busy work week, assignments due for school, and a work trip to Sydney on Friday, so I expect to be incoherent and seriously needing sleep by the weekend. But that's just the way of it, and it's all good. 
Love to all
Kaz  Hello Caz and a very big welcome to you! I'm so pleased you've joined us.
What you have described is very familiar - it's common for it to take some time to diagnose bipolar, often there are other diagnoses beforehand, guess it's not an easy thing for a lot of doctors to understand. It's also common for us to have to try a number of drugs before finding one that works and has minimal or acceptable side effects.
And I really relate to the frustration and anger you're feeling. I went through that too - I was diagnosed at 53 after many years of being treated for depression. I was furious for a while that it have never been considered before, and how different things might have been if I'd known, In my case it took about three months for the drugs to become effective and that period was difficult, waiting, waiting, thinking it wasn't working.
But, in time I came to terms with the late diagnosis and accepted that at least now I had a reason for things I'd done or ways I had been in the past. I wasn't a bad or difficult person, I was bipolar. And after about three months the drugs settled in and I'm pleased to say that  while I still have bad days and the occasional rapid cycle, I am better now than I have been for a long time.
It's hard when we are (as I am) impatient by nature to tell ourselves just be patient. But that's what we have to be, all the time believing this will improve. That's the hope bit, hold on to that. It's there. And meanwhile, we're here for you to vent to, sound out and lean on. 
One thing I'd point out is that because bipolar is seen as an episodic illness - which is understandable because clinicians see us in our up or down episodes - there isn't a lot of information on the dailyness of living with bipolar. But it is a daily thing - in the way we think, perceive things, mild ups, mild downs, urges, fatigue, fragility. And that's where self care comes in. Paying attention each day to how we're feeling is important, so we can potentially ward off triggers etc. It's important to get into a regular sleep pattern, eat well, stay well hydrated, get a bit of exercise, and learn to recognise and avoid things that disturb us - like toxic people.
I suggest you read everything you can lay hands on from reputable sources. Knowledge is power. 
I have soooo much more to say (of course 😀) and I hope to chat with you again soon.
Very best to you Caz (great name by the way)
Kaz Morning all - a very big welcome to Issi and Chameleon1, great to have you here! I hope you find it as informative, supportive and downright fun as I do.
Dottie - I understand about the assignments etc. I've got some due at the moment too and work's full on as well. But it's all good, I just won't be doing much else for a bit.
Mallow - I should come with you to your psych. You've described me exactly re anger and not testing my thoughts before deciding they are truth. The seeing thoughts as truth has always been a problem for me. As for bottling up anger ... yep. I bottle it up until it comes out my eyes in watery stuff, then I explode into a tornado. Sigh.
Hey, I read a really interesting article this week about changes that can happen to our eyes in our different states. Apparently when we're hypomanic or manic in a euphoric way our eyes can look very sparkly and large and we can have a glow to our skin (sounds good to me!). And when we're manic but in an angry or agitated way (dysphoric) they become small and narrow. And when we're depressed they become sunken and much darker than usual. Some people even say their eyes change colour. Apparently this can help our loved ones 'read' us when we're either unaware or trying to hide what's happening. Who knew!
Cheers all, off to do school work.
Kaz  Just had a thought, especially for our new folks - here's a couple of my favourite bloggers on bipolar. They have helped me understand the dailyness of living with bipolar, as opposed to the more extreme episodes when we might need to seek help. Clinicians generally see bipolar as an episodic condition, I guess because they treat us when we're in a definable episode. It takes someone living with bipolar to understand the everyday aspects. These bloggers are worth a read.

Love to all
Kaz  Hi metester! Welcome to the forum and to our great little gang here. It's very good to meet you. 
Thank you for sharing your story - So much of what you say is my story too, though I was only diagnosed a year ago. I often miss the blissfully unaware, but I still struggle a bit with the guilt, regrets etc over things I did when I was blissfully unaware and convinced that my ways were the ways everyone thought and did things. 
Hard as it is, I thnk I prefer being aware, and like you, I've reached a point of acceptance. I love your attitude and approach to living with bipolar, especially the mantra of 'will it improve the future'. 
Again like you, it's a daily thing for me that I need to manage, but mostly I do. Sometimes it catches me unawares and that's annoying. 
I look forward to sharing more with you. Hope you stay with us.
Hi to Len, Issi, Chae and everyone else here.
Cheers
Kaz
xx I nearly forgot! Today is World Bipolar Day! Yaaaaaay!!
Now, I'm not sure what that means exactly. Maybe the whole world becomes bipolar for a day (imagine that haha) or maybe the rest of the world has to be nice to us (I like that idea). Maybe the head hamster has a day off (bliss) and those of us who experience the shopping compulsion get discounts! Yep, that'll do me.
Whatever it means - it's OUR DAY! 
I hope it's a good one for us all. Do something special for yourselves today my lovely friends.
Kaz
xxx I'm loving this bipolar day thing. Look! It's brought us new friends! A very big welcome to Hopefulldance and quirkywords (great name), so pleased to see you here.
Hopefulldance, I'm a fellow traveller - nearly six years sober after a looong time abusing alcohol. Basically I went cold turkey after an incident in which I nearly ended things. Giving up is possibly the hardest and definitely the best thing I've done. I have another thread called Battling the Booze where those who have and those who are swap experiences and support each other. You are very welcome to join us there. BUT that doesn't mean you leave this thread! You're ours now. 😀
Hiya quirkywords! I love that you embrace your quirkiness - I do too, well I try anyways. No shame in this neck of the woods! Or anywhere. And I'm glad you're enjoying the thread. Nice bunch hey?
Len my mate - sorry you're struggling. Better day tomorrow I hope. And I hope tonight is a good one - nice dinner, nice relax, good sleep. xx
Hiya Lady S - I'm really pleased to hear you got some helpful help and you're feeling better. That work experience sounds good - you'll get some skills for the CV. Excellent!
Chae - enjoy the happy! I love it when that happens. 😀 Try hard not to worry about the physical stuff (sorry you're in pain though). Hopefully the medicos will sort that out without too much pain and discomfort.
Hi to Mallow, Dottie and anyone else looking in. A peaceful World Bipolar Night to all.
Love, Kaz
xx LOL! Hiya Mallow. Good to see you matey. 
I'm sitting here trying very hard not to ruminate on a situation I experienced today where a colleague and I tried to help someone in serious distress and it all went a bit pear-shaped. As a mental health worker in the making, I guess it's useful experience. Some tough lessons though.
Anyways, I actually popped in to explain the head hamster in case our new friends are wondering. It's a Mallow creation (thanks Mallow 🙂). He once described the bipolar racing thoughts and scrambled mind as like having a hamster running on a wheel in your head. And it's since become the head hamster. I think it's a perfect description. Mine's having quite a workout at the moment dammit.
Cheers all
Kaz  Hiya Chae - hope you enjoyed your ice cream. I find ice cream helps in every situation. Your hamster situation (with weasels!) is awful hun - I remember being in a similar state when I was diagnosed. I was rapid cycling. Don't let it go too long before seeing your doc hey? 
Thanks for asking after me too - I'm fine today, not sure about the lady in distress though, I don't know the outcome. I hope she's safe in hospital.
Hi to everyone! Hope it's been a good day.
Cheers
Kaz
xx Morning all - just checking in to say hi and hope everyone's OK. 
Busy busy in Kaztown at the moment, but I'm pleased to report the hamster is playing nicely. Touch wood, I'm having a period of peace, clarity and focus in my head at the moment. Sometimes I don't realise how much bipolar affects me until I get a clear run of time when it doesn't. Does that make sense?
Chae - yes hun, anxiety, including OCD, is a common companion of bipolar unfortunately. Make sure you talk to your doc or the psych about it when you finally get an appointment. There are medications that can help, you just have to be careful not to take more than prescribed (I have a friend in hospital at the moment who overdid the anti-anxiety drugs and now has to withdraw from them).
You know folks, I count my blessings everyday. Where I work there are a lot homeless folks and people with serious mental illnesses (quite a few have bipolar) who attend a drop in centre and soup kitchen. I've got to know some of them, nice people. I often think if my bipolar brain chemistry was just a tweak more abnormal, I'd be them. It's a matter of degrees in severity. 
I hope that doesn't sound patronising or judgemental, it's certainly not meant to be. It's why I want to do what I do. People are people are people in my view. But some of us have been dealt a better hand in the brain stakes than others. And even when the hamster's being a pain in the head I'm grateful for what I am.
Stay well lovelies, and have a good day.
Kaz
xxx Hiya Mallow - I'm hanging out for Easter too mate. Can't wait for a break and time to get down and dirty in the garden.
I like Ruby Wax too. 😀 You know she has a masters degree in mindfullness or some such? She sure knows what she's on about. And yes, not wanting to discourage anyone from trying mindfullness but ... it doesn't work for me, or at least I haven't been able to learn how to do it properly. Would be interested in others' thoughts on it.
Have a good day folks - hope it's hamster free. 
Kaz Hi everyone - just popping to wish Issi the very best for the hospital stay. I'd be interested to hear more about your experience of TMS Issi - only if you're comfortable sharing of course. Take care hun and I hope all goes well.
 Hugs to everyone - it's a cool, snuggle up night here. Nice. 😀
Kaz Morning lovely Chae! 
Yes, I have heard of melatonin - it's a hormone, naturally occurring in the brain, that regulates sleep. From what I understand, it's not directly related to bipolar as such, but it can help us get regular quality sleep which is essential for stabilisation, especially for reducing the risk of hypomania or mania. A friend of mine has taken it to help with sleep (instead of benzos or other habit-forming anti anxiety drugs).
Sorry to hear about the tears. I know you love this person, but he's causing you too much grief my dear. Time will heal, truly. Have a good gym, and hope you feel much better afterwards.
Happy Sunday to everyone else too!
Cheers
Kaz 
  Clothes (and shoes) shopping is my favourite feel-good pastime. Op shops mainly, so I don't feel bad about spending. I got a beautiful green coat for $15 yesterday. It's a bit big, but I had to have it for the colour. Now I need green boots. 😀 
Enjoy hun, and let me know what you find.
Kaz
xx Oooohhhh, well done Chae! Boots and a tattoo! Now that's my idea of a good time. 😀 Much respect to you for getting the semicolon too. I'm thinking about a new tattoo for my sixth sober anniversary (May) and would like to incorporate the semicolon in a design. It will also be six years since I tried not to be here.
Hiya Len my buddy! I'm really good at the moment thanks mate. I'm wildly envious of your weight loss! Well done, I hope you feel proud of yourself, that's a huge achievement. Is it getting chilly in your beautiful part of the world? Canberra hasn't quite decided yet ... good gardening weather though. I'm taking some extra days off over Easter to attack my back yard. Bliss.
Morning to all here and anyone looking in. Hope you're all OK and enjoying the countdown to Easter. Anyone got nice plans for the break?
Love 
Kaz  Morning all, whatever time that might be for you. 😀 I am a morning person, always up early, but I'm useless at night, often in bed soon after dinner. 
And yes, routine is very important for me too. Takes a while to recover if I have to do something that doesn't fit my routine, especially my sleep pattern. Isn't it great to have others here who understand things like that! I hate having to explain why I won't go to things, or stay overnight on a work trip etc - 'because I need my routine' just makes me sound old and pathetic. 
Quirky - do you have a bookshop on the coast? Oooohhh, that's been a dream of mine for a long time! Maybe one day ...
We have big plans for the backyard - total relandscaping. Fortunately The Pom (that's my gorgeous husband) was a landscaper and can do all the hard work while I do the 'lady gardening' (his words) of planting pretty things. 😀
I had a crap day at work yesterday. Got triggered by a close encounter with bureaucracy (long story, I used to be a bureaucrat in the federal public service). I didn't handle it well, and it sent me back to experiences last year that made me very unwell. I work with wonderful people now though, so I had lots of support, and I'm OK today. But geez I wish I could pull back when something sets off the anger and frustration. Any tips folks?
Have a good day my friends.
Kaz
xx I'm so glad you didn't disappear Len. You're a good friend and special person we would never have known ... Mega hugs to you too, and sleep well.
Night
Kaz  Hiya Len - you're an old hand at this and don't really need my suggestions, but that's never stopped me. 😀 Mate, you're aware there might be an episode lurking, so now's a good time before it hits to write yourself a big note that says 'this will pass' or 'I'll get through this' or whatever resonates with you, and put it where you'll see it each day.
Maybe also ask your lady to remind you each day that you will come through. The Pom does that for me. 
And maybe another note that says 'post on BB'. We'll be here for you.
Stay close.
Kaz  Morning Len - it's so good you have a lot of support. Makes all the difference hey? And you have a plan, and a 'safety net'. Excellent.
How are you today my friend? I'll be thinking of you while I'm pottering in the garden today - my happy place.
Morning to everyone else - hope your day has good experiences that you can hang on to and remember when you need to. 
Love to all
Kaz 
  Hey, how about that! What a talkative bunch. Goes with the territory sometimes hey. 😀
Thanks Tony - good to see you mate, hope all is well for you. Happy Easter!
Cheers
Kaz  Happy Easter from me too! Have a good day folks. 
Love
Kaz Morning all - just a little heads up. We have a new member Dimityrose and both Quirky and I have invited her to join us here. I know we'll all make her welcome if she does.
Dimityrose if you're reading - it would be great if you want to pop in and say hi.
Hope everyone is OK - I'm busy busy and adjusting to being on my own because The Pom has had to go to the UK for a couple of weeks. I'm not real good at being alone - routine goes right out the window and the head hamster goes feral. I took a wrong turn and got lost on the way to work again yesterday. Focus Kaz, pay attention! Wish I could do that being present in the moment thing. But I did find a lovely green handbag on a therapeutic detour to a favourite op shop on the way home. 😀
Have a good day all.
Kaz  Morning all and belated happy birthday Mallow! Forty is a good age no matter how old you are I reckon. 😀
Welcome welcome Dimityrose, so good to see you here. Re spending sprees, I think you've joined a bunch of experts. Like Quirky I try to limit myself to op shops. I have a shoe thing. And handbags. Clothes are pretty nice too. 
I'm in a bit of a spending thing at the moment because I'm a bit stressed and jangled because my hubby is away. (It's all his fault.) So, the other night with nothing else to do I found a pair of shoes I needed on Gumtree, and arranged to meet the seller near where I work. When I left work to collect them yesterday I felt like I was going to meet my dealer haha! Still, there's worse things I could be addicted to (I know, I have been). 
This morning I am off to aquaerobics with my buddy that I volunteer with. I really really don't feel like it. It's raining and I rather be in bed. But I'm forcing myself so I don't let her down, and so I keep up something of a normal routine while The Pom is away. I know I could very easily slide into just hiding at home for four days, not doing anything except sleeping, not talking to anyone, so I have to force myself. I can do this. Sigh.
Have a good day everyone.
Cheers
Kaz 
 
  Yup - I don't understand people who don't always need shoes. There's something wrong with them I reckon. 😀 xx Hi folks - I had the good fortune to meet another three lovely people with bipolar this afternoon, new members of our bipolar support group. 
Something wonderful happens when people are with others who truly understand, know they are safe to talk about anything, know they won't be judged, and can relax and not have to pretend. To continue our shoe talk - it's like putting on a pair of comfy slippers after a day wearing heels. 😀
If any of you have a bipolar support group nearby I really recommend checking it out. And if you do, know that everyone is anxious at first but that soon passes when you get talking.
And now I'm talked out. Nap time.
Hope you've all had a good day. 
And just a little call out to our Len - hope you're OK mate and all is well in your world. My footy team went down again yesterday and I remember you prescribing chocolate for that situation once. Damn fine advice. Might have to Raiders the cupboard.
Cheers all
Kaz 
  Hi Quirky
I'm 54 - birthday in March, so a tad older than Len. Guess that makes you the grown up! Excellent - I'm not always good at being grown up. 😀
To put up a pic, go to My Profile in the top right hand corner of the screen, to My Account, then to Edit Profile Image (or something like that) and follow the instructions. (I think that's right but I'm no techy). Let me know if you have trouble and I'll get better instructions from one of our more capable champions.
Hiya Len - good to see you mate. It's great you're in such a good space - you deserve it my friend because you have put a lot of hard work into your recovery. 
I have deliberately not learned how to use eBay. I occasionally check out Gumtree (see shoes mentioned above) but mainly for furniture or garden stuff. eBay would bring me undone I reckon.
So, there's nothing good on the tele, I've already Skyped with The Pom, can't be bothered with dinner, so I'm off to bed with a book - at 8.30 on a Saturday night. Tragic. Nice ... actually really nice ... but still a bit tragic. Cest la vie.
Cheers all
Kaz  Hello Possum and a very big welcome to the bipolar bunch. I'm so sorry to hear about your mum. 
To answer your question - I think it could be both. Anyone in that situation would be going through a whirl of emotions - times of great sadness and feeling immobilised, and times of high activity, trying to do something to help. Having bipolar might exacerbate the situation, because in many ways what we experience and do is just a more extreme or magnified version of what everyone else feels and does. My sense is that what you are experiencing is entirely normal for your situation. 
It's really important during a time like this that you take good care of yourself. Tend to your needs too. Make sure you keep on track with your medication. Get decent rest, and eat properly. And know you can come here any time - to vent, offload, or for light relief. (We have a lot of fun on this thread).
Great to meet you and I look forward to talking soon.
Cheers
Kaz Must admit I feel a bit hypocritical telling anyone to look after themselves at the moment. I'm not doing a very good job of it. With my hubby away I'm feeling really flat, sad and mopey. Missing him so much. 
And I'm doing all the bad stuff (well, not all - no booze here) - eating vegemite sandwiches instead of cooking, smoking lots when I'm up, but mostly staying in bed, getting up, going back, not doing any housework or washing that needs doing. 
I went out yesterday and had a good day, as I mentioned in an earlier post, but today I'm useless. Had a little potter in the garden earlier but lost interest. I feel like I'm just treading water till he comes home - in 12 days.
So, having admitted to myself that I'm in a funk, I will do everything I can tomorrow to turn it around. Will go food shopping. Will cook and eat properly. Will at least do some washing. Will (try to) stay out of bed.
Sigh.
Love to all here
Kaz Hi Possum - sorry hun, your post came in as I was writing my last one. Support is what we do best here, so I'm really glad you're here with us.
I lost my mum 16 years ago, and I remember how hard it was. A big hug to you. Please do feel free to talk in whatever way you want. In a way, you're preparing for grief, and I think that's a very difficult but important thing to do. I hope we can help in some way.
Kaz Morning Dimity, your comment about changing my hair colour made me smile. I do y'know, every six weeks or so - from grey to brown haha. My daughter who's 28 reckons I should stop and let it be naturally grey. Uhhhh, nup. I don't act my age so why should I look it? 😀
Hun I think you are very wise to be asking questions about medication and pregnancy, and how to cope with baby when you're also coping with bipolar. Even though I have two kids (adults) I can't really help because I'm a late onset person. But, I know there is a lot to consider, and the best thing you can do is start talking with your doctor and psych.
It is certainly possible to have children and manage with bipolar, but you might just need to be prepared for some difficult times and needing a bit of extra help - your partner, parents, friend etc, or paid carer. If you can line that up beforehand, prime the people who love you that you might need them more, then that's probably the way to go.
As for coming off the drugs, again talk with your doc and be fully aware of what it will be like. And stay supervised while you do. Getting off medication can be hell, but doing it to have a child is the best possible reason hey?
Hope you have a good day today.
Cheers
Karen Hiya Issi - good to see you! And thanks for popping in with advice for Dimity. Nothing like getting it from someone who's been there.
Anniversaries are hard, and three years isn't a long time. Sit with the happy memories, think of all they gave you. Doesn't stop you missing them in my experience, but the sadness  becomes sweeter in time.
The Pom's away for another 12 days (and counting). But, I have been a good Kaz today - done the food shopping and some washing. Not in bed or staring at the wall. I can do this.
Quirky my dear, you nailed it. Not knowing if I'm reacting like other people is a regular worry for me. Something I was totally blissfully ignorant of before my diagnosis (just a year ago). I just thought everyone thought and reacted like I did and there was something different about them if they didn't. How the hell could I get to my 50s believing that, when all along I was the one that was different! I suspect I've had a lot of tolerant people, or at least very polite people, in my life. I'm constantly scared that maybe people I thought liked me were really just putting up with me all this time because they had to, especially family and colleagues. But you can't change the past hey. We move on, with new awareness .. and frequent confusion. Sigh. 
'Take my advice, I'm not using it.' Oh I love that. 😀
Cheers all. 
Kaz
  Hi remember me, and a very big welcome to the forum and to our lovely gang here. I'm Kaz.
You can certainly talk to us - your post will resonate with all of us I reckon. I certainly know the laying in the couch thing - I've been doing a lot of that lately too.
Depression is the pits, literally. And no matter whether we're medicated properly or not, it still appears sometimes, but hopefully less severe than without the medications. I become immobilised when I'm depressed and I know how very hard it is to get up and do anything. So I say very well done to you for cleaning your house! To many people that would seem like a small thing, but to us it can be huge. Take that onboard - try not to think 'well at least I cleaned the house'. Try to think 'how good am I for doing that.'
Have you talked with your doc recently about medication? It's always worth getting a review when things aren't going well, just in case you need a different dosage or change in antidepressant or such.
It's hard not to hide what's going on, even with a psych. It's almost like if we admit how much we're struggling it makes it real and we have to face it. But, we don't really help ourselves by pretending. If anything, we compound what's already happening to us. Try hard to talk openly with your psych. If that's too difficult, maybe write something about how you're feeling and take it with you. It's sometimes easier to write than to speak.
I am  very glad you've joined us and look forward to getting to know you. Take care today.
Kaz  Morning all - Lady Stardust great to see you again! I need to hear more about this job.
How's everyone? I've been a bit absent the past few days so I'll catch up with the convo later today.
Actually, I've been quite down and, like our new friend rememberme, spending a lot of time on the couch, just staring or watching mindless tv. I hope work today might spark me up a bit. My head hamster seems to have deserted me, which would normally be a good thing, but I think I need it back to make me move. Anyone want to lend me theirs today?
Take care lovelies.
Kaz  Hi Mallow my mate - you have really picked me with your bubbly hypo-ness and chocolaty goodness! On top of my depressive slump I now have a crappy headcold. So, I'm on the couch feeling sorry for myself, then along you come with your sparkly sack of spuds. And I smile. Cheers my friend and very best wishes for the run on Sunday.
Hi all, sorry I've been a bit absent. I'm just blaaaahhh. Will be back as bright as Mallow soon I hope. 
Cheers
Kaz  Hi everyone - sorry I've been AWOL for a while. School is back and work is busy and I'm a bit knackered. The best news is The Pom is home and all is right with my world again. 
I can see we've all had some struggles lately. It's the way of things for us, but it still sucks. I hope everyone is a bit better today.  It's so great we can stick together and support each other here. 
I have a big thing coming up at work tomorrow where I'll need to be at my professional best (ie head together, not too talkative, connected with others etc) and I'm a bit anxious. And, usually after such a thing I ruminate for hours - did I say the right things, should I have done this or that, did I offend anyone ... does anyone else do that? It's because I can't always trust my own judgment and perceptions of things. I'm very aware of it, but that doesn't stop me doing it. Any tips on how to switch off would be welcome 😀
Hope everyone has a better day today.
Hugs
Kaz
 
  Did I scare eveyone away? 😀
Hi to all - hope you're OK. Thank God it's Friday I say. 
I got through my thing at work yesterday and then had to immediately go to school, so couldn't check with my colleagues how they thought it went, and the ruminating began. Then, a lovely colleague who I had confided in about what would probably happen in my head, texted me to say they all thought it went well, good job, nothing to worry about. How incredibly kind is that!
Sometimes being open about my mental health comes back to bite me in cruel ways. But sometimes, with the right people, it really truly helps. 
Hey! It's Eurovision weekend! Wooooo hooooo!! Any other Eurovision addicts amongst us?
Cheers
Kaz  Now I'm intrigued - who is your most favourite band ever Chae?
I'm off to see The Animals next week. Not my favourite band ever, but the chance to see some legends do their legendary songs is too good to miss.
Cheers
Kaz Morning all
I will be taking a break from the forum for a while to concentrate on work and studies. I'll pop in when I can but won't be here regularly. Thank you all for your beautiful friendship and support. Keep it up - together we are stronger! 😀
Take care my lovelies
Kaz
xx Hi all, just popped in to say, ummm, hi! I'm missing my bipolar buddies. Hugs to all, and safe travels Tony.
Just finished my first semester assignments (woooo hoooo!) so I'm feeling smug. 😀
Take care everyone, see you soon.
Kaz
xx Hiya Len - good to hear from you too. Yes it's 'brisk' up here. Not exactly gardening weather. Getting a bit of frost damage on some of my young plants ...
Glad you like the new profile pic. Having planted, neglected and transplanted many roses in my time I reckon you can't kill them. So I'ved adopted the red rose (courage) as my symbol. Planning a new tattoo. 😀
Hope things are good in your lovely part of the world, and I hope the PTSD group goes well for you.
Oh! I know you do a lot of exercise - is that something you did before diagnosis, or is it something you've worked on as self-care? I'm getting quite unhappy about this medication-related weight gain thing and need to Do Something! 
Cheers mate, good to talk to you
Kaz
xx
  Hi lovelies - may I take over the world too? We would surely do a better job than the dangerously strange people who run it now. 😀
Love to all my bipolar buddies
Kaz
xxxx Hi Kaz.  What a descriptive and poignant post!  Firstly, I'm really pleased that you are now feeling well enough that you have allowed yourself to finally open up this new thread. From reading posts to the Forums over the past 6 months I can see that there are many people out there who suffer from bipolar.  And I expect that many will be able to gain insights and comfort by sharing experiences through this thread.  
There does not seem to be a very good understanding of bipolar in the general community.  So I am looking forward to gaining a better understanding of the disorder.  I'm also thrilled to finally have an appropriate place where I can check to see how you're going, and hopefully give support to you when its needed.  (-:
I'm very happy to read that today is a Ground Floor day for you! Thus you are feeling normal and content.  It sounds like the new medications have all settled.
Love to you Kaz,
Sherie xx Morning Kaz.  I hope you have gotten yourself out of the basement by now?  And are you in the elevator or the rollercoaster?
Have you been able to enjoy your weekend so far?  Like us up here, I think you are likely to get a wet day there today.  Hopefully you can do something you enjoy doing - Did you watch the Wallabies last night?  Dissappointing again werent they?  They had an absolute glut of possession, but couldnt do anything with it.  Oh well.  Bugger that Eddie Jones and also assistant coach Ella!!
I note your comment above: I don't feel I have any defences at the moment. None of the usual protective processes like reasoning or ignoring or dismissing.  Why has this changed Kaz, why do you feel you have lost your usual protection processes?  Is it the new medications, or something else?  If this doesnt improve, I think it would be worthwhile to see your Dr before the 2 weeks when your next apt is.  2 weeks is a long time when you are feeling like you are.  And even if it is just a matter of reassuring you, then its worthwhile.
You are back at work now arent you, rather then working from home?  Is there any chance that you can work from home again for a while?
From what I have read, it is a bit of a trial and error thing with getting meds right for bipolar.  A very complex procedure.  Hopefully in the end they will get it right though.  Patience though Kaz ............
Thinking of you with much affection Kaz. Now sending a big cyber hug your way - down the Pacific and Hume Hways and into the ACT. Catch it on its way through wont you, otherwise who knows where it may end up.  (-:
Sherie xx Hi there Kaz.  Just been thinking of you and wondering how you are getting along.  I note that we havent heard from you in over a week.
As your daughter with bipolar would have been through what you are going through now, ie diagnosis and likely medication, has she been helping you through this period of transition?  Perhaps as a bit of a sounding board and someone to compare notes with.  It does seem surprising that you never knew, or indeed that she never said anything to you about her diagnosis.  I understand you have a good relationship with your daughter.  Although you have said that looking back now, you can see the signs.  I guess thats fairly typical isnt it?
Anyway Kaz, I just wanted you to know that I have been thinking of you, and I'm sending some well wishes your way and a hug.  I hope you are keeping warm down there in the ACT, where I know its been very cold.
Sherie xx
  Hi Tony.  I read a little about some of your trip early on, where your friends drove off ahead of you and you subsequently broke down.  No wonder you were annoyed!  I think anybody would have been.  Are you still travelling with those people, or have you cut them loose since then?
Also I was wondering about your little dog - Miss Rosie if I recall correctly?  Have you taken her travelling with you, or did you have to leave her with someone whilst you're travelling?
I cannot claim to know anything about bipolar, so I am unable to offer any advise.  But please know I care and feel bad that things have not been easy for you.  As Paul would say ....... be kind to yourself.  (-:
Sherie xx Hi Kaz.  Yes I was aware you had one daughter overseas and one nearby.  But I wasnt sure which one had the bipolar.  But I knew that your daughter nearby had a recent health scare.  How has she been by the way?
Pleased to hear that things are starting to become a little easier for you.  Perhaps the medication is working after all.  Lets hope so anyway.  Might just need a bit of fine tuning down the track.
And thats great that you have met other people in the ACT who also have bipolar, so you have a bit of a support crew there for each other. 
It does sound as though things are finally starting to look up for you.  Its been a hard road for you, I know.
Anyway, if I am not talking to you before the weekend ....... have a good one.  Love to you.
Sherie xx I'm sorry to hear that Kaz.  Be strong, as I know you are, and you will pull through this latest hard patch.  It sounds as though your periods of 'stability' are increasing, so thats a good thing.  My thoughts are with you.
Much love to you, and a comforting hug as well.
Sherie xx Hi Kaz. Sorry to read that its been a tough week for you with work frustrations.  Oh well you now have a weekend off.  Have you been watching much of the Olympics?  What are your favourite sports?  How are your 2 dogs?
Havent seen you around much, and the fact that you've had a bad week probably explains why.  You missed a good party at the Cafe last night!  Perhaps you'll find the chance to call in over the weekend, its a Rio Olympic Celebration party and games on all weekend.  (-:
Hoping things improve again for you soon.  When was the last time you visited your Doc?  Maybe its time for a bit of a review, and you can discuss how everything is going now that some of the other medications would be settling.
Thinking of you Kaz my friend. Big hug to you.
Sherie xx Glad I gave you a smile.  (-:
I totally understand about keeping up with some of the threads, if you arent able to check every day, you just get lost.  So dont let it worry you.
Oh ... I was so happy about the Fiji Rugby 7's team!  And werent they just so humble and beautiful when accepting their gold medals from Princess Anne?  Beautiful ... beautiful.
True too about the mighty Canberra Raiders.  They are still my team, and they have been really good this year.  Do you think they can beat Melbourne Storm this weekend?  Oh .. I would love to see them go all the way.
Hope you have a restful and stress free weekend.
Love to you.
Sherie xx Hi Kaz,
I am really sorry to hear the news of your likely redundancy, as I know your work has been important to you.  For all sorts of reasons.
I'm not in a great place myself either lately, so probably not able to offer much support.  I only wish I could.  But if there is a good side to the decision, it could mean you are better able to concentrate on your own treatment and wellbeing.  And the other is that you will have more time to spend with all of us here? We are the fortunate ones if that proves to be the case. (-:
So I am thinking of you and offer you a big hug.
Sherie xx A quick hello from me so I may follow your journey, support you and learn about bipolar.
Much love to you Kaz,
Carol xx Hi Kaz,
At the height of my anxiety, exacerbated by the ADs I was on, my mind was racing like you describe. 
Like you I felt the need to do multiple things at once. The combination that worked best for me was watching a very calm tv show, something slow paced. In my case I watched Heartland. I either crocheted or coloured in the adult colouring in books (with gel pens because pencils were too slow), and (you may laugh), I ate carrot sticks because it helped further occupy my senses.  I also used a heatpack because of my pain but it is possible that something like that or a hot water bottle might help occupy other senses for you helping the mind to feel occupied.  This worked for me until the meds evened out.
I hope this may help in some way.
Kind thoughts,
Carol xx
  Hi Kaz,
Getting in as early as you can to see the dr sounds like a plan.
I have done a little reading, not much, on bipolar. I am wondering if you have tried some exercise. I read that the chemicals released during exercise can help towards mood stabilising.  I know it's late at night now but the internet would probably have free classes to follow in things like zumba for example that might help with both mood and sleep?
I know that's probably not much help so here's a gentle hug instead. 
Kind thoughts,
Carol xx
  Hi Kaz,
Best wishes for getting an early appointment tomorrow. I hope that your GP can see you quickly so you can talk through options. 
Thinking of you,
Carol xx  So calming the savage Robbie I do have experience in. I go with the tried and tested distraction followed by something that slows me down. Food, TV, Internet, exercise distracts. The calm comes from the bath, drawing... 
  Hi Kazzl
Great post! I will be learning at lot from it. I recently saw a movie that actually 'embraced bi-polar' in a caring way which helped me understand the symptoms
"Infinitely Polar Bear" A movie written and produced that respected the illness. It is available and recent.
I had a 'racing mind for so long the anxiety levels exacerbated to such a high level I had to go AD's...as well as the various coping mechanisms the AD's did slow my mind so I could function effectively in life...Paulx Hey Kazzl, I just read Tony WK's post...It feels like Im reading my own words...its remarkable
Just a friendly reminder that "Infinitely Polar Bear" A movie that embraces BiPolar and mental illness is on high rotation on Foxtel movies at the moment..under the Premiere station :-)

Paulx Hey Kaz
I feel the pain you have been going through. I wont give any advice from a guy thats in the same boat. You have my full support Kaz
(Hug) if thats okay of course. Paulxx Hi Possum
Possum said "Because there are so many negative community champions and they seem to 
encourage 'throwing in the towel' like we should just give up on any of our dream and plans because now we have a mental illness so it's all over"
We invite all people to have their say Possum no worries but if you could refrain from making unhelpful negative comments about anyone including the Community Champions. 
Im on the forums for 2 reasons...My brothers suicide (providing awareness) and supporting people in pain through my own long term experience with my anxiety/depression. 
The Champions put in many hundreds of hours as volunteers on the forums and may also find your post insulting,  sad and a reflection of your illness.
The forums also have many people that are super fragile posting here. Your comments have crossed the line and may also have a negative impact on posters too which is counter productive to what the forums represent.
I read at lot of the posts on the forums Possum. Your highlighted comments are only your interpretation of some posts on the 'Do You Love Yourself Thread', not mine or anyone else's.
Please consider all others prior to posting on any thread. Lets work as a team without the attitude...please
Thanks Possum

Always a treat to have you on the forums 
Paul Hi everyone
When new members are reading this thread maybe we can help them with some info or symptoms about Bipolar and how they have found some peace with counseling....therapy or meds?
I am not an well versed on Bipolar disorder so if anyone can offer any proactive comments about this awful condition maybe we can all learn :-)
If anyone has been diagnosed with Bipolar it would be great to hear your views

  Hello Everyone
Hi Loula.....I really hope you are doing reasonably okay...Changing meds can be a bit scary yet many people do change their meds...I understand as I have too.

  Hey Kattles
Thank-you for being a part of the forum family! You have an excellent understanding where Bi-Polar and mental health is concerned. Your husband would be happy (as you mentioned) that he was misdiagnosed..albeit somewhat frustrating and anxiety inducing!
You do sound very relieved...It must be frustrating for you regarding the incorrect diagnosis Kattles
My very best for you and your husbands health. I really hope you can continue to post with us :-)
my kind thoughts always
Paul Hi kaz,
I've found that my mood stabilisers only help me with overall mood not spontaneous "tip my bucket over" conflicts. 
My AD's help me with keeping my depression at bay....also only most times.
With this in mind and reading about your GP suggesting psych visits for more complex medication it struck a cord with me. I felt like saying to you...yes do it.
Bipolar in my experiences (diagnosed type 1 2003, correctly diagnosed type 2 2009) is more fickle in seeking the right meds for you.
The main symptom left in me is spontaneity from other people. I call it " pushing my buttons". Eg I could have a good calm conversation with someone and agree on a plan
 If the person repeats themselves about my tasks I can flip out. One work colleague reminded me 3 times to put a cover over my baked beans in the microwave all within one minute. 
I couldn't tolerate it. Don't know it that'd you but your OP was quite accurate.
Tony WK
  Hi kaz
No defences?  I've been describing this feeling over the years (to my dear wife) as "being fragile"
Don't know about you but when I'm good I am so for a couple if days and allow "water off a ducks back". Then, wham, the irritability of which you speak comes oh so fast. Unfortunately 80% of the time, my wife is the recipient.
This means a shirt time later i  do apologize and " nip it in the bud". My wife has depression, no hypomania, and between us we have a high level of acceptance of our quirks of flying off the handle.
It means we have accepted we won't ever be stable.
My depression has drifted away a lot, unless under severe stress. My dysthymia the same. So my bipolar 2 is now more prominent and its unpredictability harder to fathom.
I've tried looking for triggers and that hasn't had any conclusion. I'm convinced it is chemical in origin.
Like someone flicks a switch!!
Tony WK
  Hi kaz,
Very interesting as to possible causes if bipolar.
My sister and I now swap stories and can relate to each other. My brother took his life in 1979 at the age of 27. He was so moody. I believed all 3 siblings had bipolar early on in life.
I've also read by googling "children of borderline mother's" about common mental illnesses children of BPD mother's sometimes end up with. (This can be unfair on some bpd sufferers so please note this does not happen in all cases, that illness has enough stigma issues). Such children can suffer a wide range of issues like depression anxiety and bipolar.
It highlighted for me the parent mental illness factor which might not be a factor but is worth knowing
With my possible BPD or narcissistic mother (in denial, not diagnosed) the unpredictability, screaming, threatening suicide (I was 9 or 10 yo then and onwards), golden child one day, demon the next etc, would I feel provided the foundation for bipolar in us kids.
Good for discussion
Tony WK To right kaz
In the RAAF in 1974 as a male if you cried you were tormented by all.
Society has a long way to go but it is far better than it was.
Tony WK Sherie, you are a darling. So thoughtful
Kaz. I've been analyzing myself. As you know we are going around oz. Currently south of Bunbury.
Anyway we just spent 3 days in the perfect camping ground. A beach, only 3 other vans perfect weather and heaps of yellow ingnecked parrots feeding from your shoulder. Plenty if rest and no TV, radio etc. Bliss.
We left there this morning and we needed to find a dump point, do shopping and refuel before locating our next free camping ground.
We couldn't find a dump point and we got held up by admirers of our tiny van we made ourselves (it looks cute as a button).
That was enough to tip me over the edge.
So after an hour of wanting to take it all out on the world we stopped for a coffee looking out on the beautiful Bunbury harbour. Then I decided to try to be positive.
We did food shopping and found bargains at the supermarket. Then the next town there finally was a dump point. We've settled in our camp ground. What did I realise?
That rest and holidays make no difference to the mood swings.
That my mood stabilisers might not be effective enough
That when things go pear shaped it sets me off like triggers
That its extremely hard seeking any positive thoughts. Even though I'm a motivated positive person
That sometimes my own recommendations to others like change of environment do work but not immediately. Its like I can't break away from my mood for about 3 hours.
Tony WK
  Hi Sherie
You have a good memory
For those unaware we travelled with long time friends to Rambo outback Qld where I had a cracked drawbar on our homebuilt caravan. Our friends had a small bus and appeared OK about the 3 hour delay but unbeknown to us the male held a grudge. From then on each time we drove from a location he'd steam ahead. This puzzled us.
Outside Katherine they went ahead at can area where there was no mobile range. We broke down. We were delayed a week in hot weather waiting for repairs. We finally caught up with them in Broome and I questioned him why we were abandoned in the outback. He revealed he was angry over our drawbar breaking.
Funny enough, at Barkley Homestead on the Qld/NT border his bus needed repairs and had he needed a 7 hour return journey to Tenney Ck I told him I'd take him. I fixed his bus.
We left them in Broome. We haven't seen them since. My wife's 20 year friendship with his wife is likely finished.
We've moved on but it hurt and that one week in Katherine was a mental challenge. It tested me.
We have our foxy Miss Rosie with us. She warns us of animals ahead. We built a seat between us so she sits high. With a harness if course. We don't go anywhere without her. She's brought us so much joy.
I have depression dysthymia (constant low mood depression) and bipolar type 2. The bipolar ups and downs have been getting progressively worse. Its hard in my wife who incidentally has depression also.
We've found that both of us can snap at the other more often than other couples. We hence need to apologise more often. Overall it works but its sad knowing you've upset you partner with outbursts that you don't intend. 
This whole struggle can drag you down resulting in low self esteem. Its a "flip flop" life. When you feel good you dont think you'll ever feel bad again, then it comes out if the blue...wham.
This also happens with friendships. They, unlike my loving wife, get tired if the apologies. So sometimes I just offer an olive branch by opening up conversations. At the time when I'm annoyed I can severe friendships then full of regret. This can happen on forums to. For me its as heartbreaking as it us for the other person.
I wish I was stable but my wife always tells me I'm much more easier to live with since 2009 when I started on mood stabilisers.
That's a positive. The other positive is my handsomeness....lol Hi again everyone
I also don't make solid plans. Eg we are nearly finished our caravanning around oz. If we book into a caravan park we do so only on a daily basis. That way we can pull up stumps anytime and go without losing money.... Feeling guilty.
If we have say 4 appointments in a week like Dr, birthday party, car service etc....I feel overloaded. 
I'm in a car club. One day many of us were asked to leaf a drive. This entailed organising it then being the lead car for the run to a destination. Sounds easy. Nope, the recipe fir disaster.
If I arrive with one car missing I'd hypo ventilate... Well nearly. Fall into worry. I'd be a mess.
I should have known....told the club organisor and was met with disrespect.
One fb friend once called me "fickle". She was correct. This is how some bp people are....certainly not boring.
Very unpredictable though. Even the sufferer can't know how they will feel in a few hours time.
Tony WK
Tony WK Hi ijg
Thanks fir your input
I have two comments based on assumption only.
Firstly I don't believe actions like leaving ones partner would be done often based on the illness alone. Bp highs and lies are like normal peoples ups and downs but much more steep a curve and more often.
Secondly, step parent situations although very common now, are often complex stressful lifestyles. I was step dad to 3, children in two different relationships. I left believing its a tough gig.
Summing up, I believe bp and other mental illnesses  although having a devastating effect on a relationship, would not cause the demise of a marriage alone. It likely has other issues as a core if the problem.
Her children causing her stress us for her to sort out. In my experience, parents usually won't combat it. They won't insist their kids consider her health for example. This stress she has isn't fair but shell tolerate it because she knows no other way.
Finally, your health is now number one. You must distance yourself from issues you have no control over. Be realistic. Continue treatment for your problems and limit scenario's because "what if's" are great for feeding anxiety and depression.
Charity begins at home and home is where people love you
My view
Tony WK
  Hi ijg
Oh, bipolar 1 ...much more severe. Sorry I assumed bipolar 2.
Yes that restraining order would be hard to handle. You need to convince yourself that what is out of your control is just that. Nothing you can do.
As a therapist reminded me once, "you can't save the world"
Its tough. Time is an incredible healer.
Tony WK
  Hi kaz
I too scrutinize what I say. I feel freakish but I know I'm not. Foot in mouth is common among ADHD sufferers. Interesting.
Igbran, I've been on mood stabilisers for six years 800mg. But was moody, tried 1200, still moody, over time went down to 400....wow, what a huge positive difference.
Not suggesting advice on dosage but giving you an example that too much meds can be counter productive. It has to be in the ball park.
The best judge, my wife. Her comment "I've got my husband back"
Tony WK Hi kaz,
I'm wondering why you desire to reduce your world, for I have the same feelings.
To describe mine, its like I'm on a battlefield and everyone but those close to me or trustworthy, is charging at me, towards my fort. Then as they advance over the wall I retreat to the next barricade to fight again. Constantly threatened and its exhausting. I this k it'd linked to low self esteem from questioning ourselves.
While on our recent trip, we had a fire going. A couple arrived and, as is common, they automatically joined us. The man went to collect wood while the lady brought cake out.
This is common as is the waving to each other as caravanners pass each other.
But initially I didn't want such contact. I don't trust others now as I did years ago. It went through my head...is he a racist (turned out he was against indigenous), nasty, ex criminal, not tolerant of mental issues in others. What if I get moody?
And her, will she be judgemental, domineering like my mother.?

Tony WK Hi Len,
So know that feeling if a full bucket that runneth over so much easier than those with half empty one.
The metaphor below puts it in perspective I think. Google
Topic: depression, a ship on the high seas- beyondblue
Being semi mentally crippled is a big let down seeing as most of us in a younger life were do much more capable. We have to accept s mind that is restrictive and had an occasional mirage....ever felt really good as you did when younger as if you can conquer the world only for depression to near disable you the next day?
Sadly those around ud cannot fathom the seriousness of the loss if ability. 
Not being capable if juggling more than one thing at a time has resulted in my raising my voice "you know I can't take on two tasks at once, how many times do I have to tell you"?
Of course its unfair to expect change from others. So answer us to use a notepad to write it down...after all I have to own my own issues.
I hope you improve Len

  Hi confusion personified, welcome
Your bipolar is part if you. Your personality is part of you. The total package is ..you.
Stephen Fry said this. You can google his quotes. As he said, if he was cured tomorrow he'd feel like he's lost himself.
So, you can't take a leap forward with this new development by not analysing it and building confidence. Every morning look in the mirror and tell yourself what a good person you are. Program your day ahead with a smile.
I wrote an article ...Google...Topic: depression are there any positives- beyondblue
The good news from me anyhow, is that there can be a sweet spot regarding medications. Its taken me a while but with mood stabilisers and a small dose of AD's I'm OK. 
I also found several of life's factors play a role...google this please...Topic: be radical- beyondblue
Again, a warm welcome here. Its a great anonymous place.
Tony WK One of my assets is being decisive. Except when it comes to diets and my eating habits...there is no discipline there.
So on my 60th birthday earlier this year I decided I would no longer worrying about my weight...why? Because I've worried all my life and that worry hadn't resulted in a good result.
So while I'll watch what I eat and get some exercise in, I've removed a factor that could end in a stroke if I kept stewing over my weight.
It was time to move on from that line of thought.
Tony WK Hi all.
Just wanted to drop by to congratulate Kaz in reaching 200 posts for this valuable thread.
:)
Tony WK Thanks Kaz I as usual spent a quiet night with my wife and her friend here in the countryside.
I thought long and hard about my bipolar 2017 year ahead and a few resolutions have been put in place.
Im embarking on writing more poetry. Something I shelved some time ago.
Ill listen to the pan flute on YouTube more often and the great Leonard Cohen. One of his songs 'sisters of mercy" I love and tower of song and I'm your man. He was s great poet. I'm in awe of him.
I want to be more tolerant to my beautiful wife. She puts up with my moods that never disappear fully with those stabilisers.
I want to value every breath I take. Listening to YouTube Maharaji- sunset and "the perfect instrument" helps a lot there. I bang on a lot about his teachings but they have formed a large part in my recovery.
All the best for 2017

Cheers  Tony WK  Hi V,
Loneliness. I assume you have bipolar 1 or 2. With Kaz resting up I'm hoping to fill a void here if I can.
I have bipolar 2, depression, dysthhymia (low mood constant depression), dwindling anxiety and I strongly believe melancholy depression is present judging by my sad poetry and easy gravitation to sad thoughts. I'm stable on my meds...as stable as I'll likely get.
So, any wonder us sad souls are lonely. How could most people even try to grasp the enormity of how we feel.?
But some give it a strong go at understanding. These people have empathy. They can reach out to us because they have an amazing level of compassion. Bipolar individuals need these people in their lives. In fact I'd go further...if I was single I'd make it a must that my date reveal that side to their character early in the peace, just like a single mum looks for step parent qualities or we seek out how comfortable we are in communication, goals, interests etc.
Here we can explore ways to feel less lonely. The forum can fill a gap but wont heal the wound of feeling alone.
So V, what is the main reason you feel lonely? We might be able to help.
Tony WK  Hi Possum
One of the difficulties with mental illness and its and ongoing problem, is not knowing if our issue is due to normal stuff or the bipolar.
Plenty of people feel lonely or detached from others. Is the loneliness we feel any different? I say it is. I base that on the fact that I've had 4 long term relationships all over 7 years long. At the end of each one I was alone and lonely. 
However that was a lonliness based on not having a partner. That's normal. The lonliness we are talking about is what I feel is an emptiness, that my mind is coping with the symptoms of bipolar "within one own mind without help". That no one can help me at that time, it's a hollow feeling.
A wise old lady told me once "we're born alone and we die alone, so we also live alone".
It was a sad statement but I find positives in every negative so I see that statement as one whereby I endeavor to share my inner thoughts with my soul mate, my wife.
Most times my wife understands.  I try not to flood her with this chatter but it makes me feel I am not hollow, I'm lucky to be able to share my insecurities with her.
How do you members feel about this solo feeling?
Tony WK  Hi
Possum, my wife has depression,  I think thats why she has empathy
 I'm lucky.
However C, I was single at 27yo (now 61) after a 7 year relationship ended. All my mates were married and having kids. And yes that kids talk at work was relentless.
For those reasons I rushed into marrying the wrong girl. We had two children and after 11 years of emotional abuse I went down the suicide path.  My brother had taken his life when I was 24. I stopped myself. A week later I left her. 
Your music sounds great. I'm into poetry. Some of my poems are in the poetry corner on this forum.

What it explains is to do a u-turn from what you are doing. Sitting in the floor crying can accelerate to a worse distraught situation and thats no good for anyone.
Get up and do something, cook a cake, do a jigsaw, go for a walk (best not drive)
In the state you are in its tempting to fall further in despair. Our test is to confront this by having our cry, then move to do something.
I hope you feel better soon.
Tony WK  Actually V, its all positive.
You got active anyway, you focussed on other things and readers (and there are many and most would relate) will read how you recovered.

Tony WK  Hi V and Suzi
Hhuman interaction is a minefield for bipolar people.
If I can stereotype a little. We reach out but go one step further with being able to "walk a mile in their shoes". We are proactive with our excitement in obtaining new friends yet it isnt reciprocating. We take rejection to a new level. Etc.
Many years ago I recognised all of this amd embarked on a proactive way if "getting it and keeping it all in best perspective.
The result was a mid way point between active involvement society and a full recluse. At the ideal point for me I could increase my involvement in society and withdraw as my mood and tolerance ebbed and flowed.
For example. In the very small town we now live, I am actively trying to get a rotunda built in a park. The local town committee are supporting the project. Every meeting they ask me if I'm willing to join the committee and each time its "thanks but no thanks".  Its a healthy thing for us to know our limits and mould our environment to suit

Both my siblings and I have frizzy hair.
My hair also goes in different directions which I read somewhere can be a sign of mental illness. Its also very thick hair so I use a number 1 cut.
Not good as a child when long hair was cool. Cruel friends.
Tony WK  Hi all, 
 Thank goodness I no longer work. I was up till 5am tjis morning. Ive got a speech to the local council on Tuesday night about why we need a park rotunda in our town.
Also, ive been lobbying the lical action group and it seems a few arent warming to the concept.
So have been restless 
tony wk Hi possum
The rules of the forum are clear about types and brands of medications. The problem being othets might think they should take the same as the next person. Medications are far more complicated than that.
I dont do a lot of work around our small town, just this building on this occasion.
Tony WK  Hii all and older members returning.
I've  got bp2, depression, dysthymia  (low mood constant depression and now anxiety gone after 30 years if trying to rid it from my life.
So, Possum, I take your point. But ad you can see, my meds would be unique to me. I think reading up on Dr google would be better than reading what others take with meds. Just my view. 
In 2003 I was misdiagnosed with adhd and bipolar1. So for 6 long years took the wrong meds. It was hell. Then got a second opinion and the right meds...bingo.  since 2009 life has been great....with the common issues with enduring bp2 and depression.
So it, prescribing meds is complex and individual. Anyway I dont know other reasons why brands of meds are not permitted.
Obviously I promote a second opinion.
Tony WK  Hi all.
Misdiagnosis?. Great topic for us bipolars.
Initially in 2003, i read a book called "ADHD IN ADULTS" by weiss. It was me, I was convinced. 6 years on the wrong meds. The psych also said I had bipolar 1.
Wrong on both counts.
So mania could be seen as adhd and bpd as bipolar and ptsd as maybe burnout.
Tony WK  I'm at a very low point. 
My God life can be tough. What is difficult when this low is having faith. Faith that you'll come out if it, faith that one day your spouse will accept your poor memory and your confused thoughts, faith that people around you will not harm you with their words of poor choice and faith that you will survive....its that bad, that low.
I'm lucky that we're heading off to Queensland tomorrow towing our little van. We towed it around Oz last year. This time with our vintage convertible car. Its exciting and knowing my track record, I'll put in place all the strategies I preach about in order to recover.
Thankyou all of you kind hearts.
Tony WK  Thankyou.
Funny how, when at a low point, its like returning home. Such is the frequency of hiw often I've been there.
I'm sure I'll  be ok.

Tony WK  Hi Fiasco
Welcome to this bipolar thread
Its nice to think along the lines of natural remedies, and thatd your choice, but the seriousness of some disorders mean you'll be dancing around the problem with not enough potency to correct the problem so you can lead a life to your best potential.
In my case, my most obvious symptoms (of my bipolar) are mood swings... so, 8 years ago commenced mood stabilisets. From then on it has been a case, a relative simple case to fine tune the dose.
I dont see any natural remedies have such targeted effect.
Anyway I'm glad youre here.

Tony WK  Hi Saphira welcome 
Me and my 2 siblings have or had issues- fragility of mood/stress, temperamental, nastiness, over reactive, desire to escape society, emotional.
My brother at 26yo took his life in 1979. No doubt had the above issues but undiagnosed. My sister and I both diagnosed with bp2, depression and anxiety. I also have dysthymia.
Just like quirky when I let off steam I say regretful words. In fact in that action I draw parallels with that sympton in ADHD with "foot in mouth", when we talk without thinking. But that could be my mania. Some illnesses cross over. I was misdiagnosed in 2003 with bp1 and ADHD and had neither but some dymptoms were there.

Not really, for the first time in 5 years my anxiety has returned to near peak levels. Add to that the bipolar swings of loving affectionate Tony to semi rage anger at the world views.
Think I should leave the tourist packed coast and head inland, quite towns, less people, free camps.

24 degrees. But my local vouncil approved a large rotunda type building in our local park, my pet project, so we are on the way back.Our trip had  a mechanical breakdown in our vintage car in Wagga but lucky it has a Holden engine. Regardless it triggered my moods for two weeks. It took a long time recovering.
Back on track but bipolar moods are hard work.
Tony WK 
  Hi Quirky
I'm best described as "fragile" mentally. If I'm busy, and I often am, if someone starts talking to me it overloads my mind. I no longer habe the capability to delay something because my memory, short term is gone.
 Money worries, stress from others , selfish people, beauocracy etc can be triggers.
Tony WK  Yes its been quiet here.
As many know I endured a bad bad bipolar period early this week. Here is a summary
About 7 weeks ago began to feel low mood. Mid last week really low mood. Early this week a real crisis. Tuesday began feeling better. Wednesday felt fully recovered and has been that way since.
My research on bipolar moods found that it can last just hours, days or longer, different to depression that comes and goes more regularly. Both unpredictable and I didnt know when I'd recover and expected to recover when I didnt.
Quite confusing. My wife knew when I was revovering yelling out "you're  back" yet I felt only a little better. I asked her how she knew.
"You told a joke you read from facebook"
Interesting.
So we have to keep learning about ourselves.
Tony WK  Hi all
For tjose unaware I've fully recovered from my bipolar downer.
It came grafually over an 8 week period, even with some self hate and dare I say...self harm. The latter a first fir me and we'll leave at that. It wont happen again
quirky said ", not a bipolar mood, but a short intense mood that is often caused when someone says something critical too me. It feels horrible but I know it wont last long"
Absolutely know that feeling. It hits me hard like someone has poured hot water on my brain.. ..a rush of sorts when criticised.
Anyway last week it came to a head but two or three days later it was over.  Oddly enough it was my wife that told me it had passed!
I've been quiet here as I've been on holiday to Queensland.  Every reason to be happy. I'm convinced most of my issues are chemical imbalance, few triggers there.
Tony WK  Hi Issi,
During these downers we have difficulty having faith thst we will recover. Please have that faith.
Tony WK  Hi all.
Here's my take on bipolar. Its now bipolar spectrum apparently! It used to be bipolar 1 or 2
Anyway Im bipolar 2, as well as depression, dysthymia (low mood constant depression ) and lingering anxiety that used to be intense.
So Firstly if depressed I used to not be able to differentiate between illnesses. What illness caused that bad mood, what illness caused the depression? But as time went on and with adjustment of mood stabilisers and AD's it became more apparent. 
My bipolar mood can be more debilitating than my depression down times. When I go through a bipolar down period it has an unknown length, my last one lasted two weeks. At the beginning of it there were no triggers, i was on holidays, no car trouble, no financial difficulties etc. Often triggers like those just mentioned can set off a depressive cycle that is (for me) more managable.
Im more emotional during depression. Im more angry during bipolar. Im not Tony when bipolar I'm more a suppressed soul. When not in a bipolar mood I can be manic but not too much so...cant sleep, in a rush, people irritate me in queues etc. 
At 61yo Im finding the symptoms dont change but my understanding of them and my communication of them to my wife has improved. We are prepared for them. Im lucky, my wife has depression (she sleeps, quite a different type) so we understand the personal challenges we both have so we have mutual support. Importantly we are direct and honest with each other. We never use mental illness as an excuse for poor behaviour. We are not afraid of apologizing. This is crutial as mi cant be accountable for some of our reactions and responses and its not meant and not our fault.
We've noticed our needs to avoid triggers. Getting out for a cappuccino and cake twice a week is essential,(we live in the country) and I drive a vintage car that tows the small caravan I built last year...thats something i love, I need that passion or I feel like a clone of everyone else. I need to be unique.
Ive found that the more anxious I am the more often my bipolar mood is erratic. After 30 years I still do my muscle tensioning exercises and watch youtube maharaji videoes (use google) both of which calm me down and help with sleeping.
A stable quiet country life has been the objective and now its been 16 years in this area its been the best move. The city life was not a great place for my issues.
Hope that helps you nice people.
Tony WK  Thanks Lady Stardust..medisafe, I'll look at that.
Hi V. Stresses is like kryptonite to Supetman with bipolar. Hence my move to the country.
Imagine a normal person carrying around a rubber cup as a symbol of their stress. But we carry a fragile glass always worried about dropping it. Along comes some stress and as your attention is taken away the glass is about to topple. The more issues around you the more it leans. So one stress is managable at any time. If we learn techniques to stote or delay other dtresses we are better off.
So common stresses that can be delayed say, while studying, are- the phone ringing (turn it off and have on your MessageBank that you are studying), have a glass of water handy, wear comfy clothes, have soft background music (I like Pechembel), use a diary and check out muscle tensioning exercises.
Anyway hope you feel better soon.
Tony WK 
  Hi Meercat
Weve been back home anout 8 weeks now. Ive been fine but a week befo re we got home I hit rock bottom.
Ive also learned through that period that suicidal thoughts can sneek in. Im not suicudal, just studied my own down period. If I didnt have the strong will Id drop into a darker place.
There was no trigger as such.
Tony WK  Hi all,
Too right Quirky. Moods can for me come like a cold shower instantly. It's like a chemical reaction.
Over the years I've identified some triggers for me. Being told off by my wife is one, when often she declares she isn't angry. I also know the origin, my mothers yelling and unreasonable (unfair) discipline techniques. The best example of many is when I didn't make my bed on a Saturday. I was 8yo. My dad was at work. Mother yelled and screamed and I jumped a metre into the air. Made my bed and thought that was that. 10 hours later dad drove up the driveway and by the time he got to the front door mother had crocodile tears. "What's up love"..."Tony, he didn't make his bed this morning and has been heel for me to deal with all day"....    Whack!!, my dad, a beautiful man till the day he died was sadly, easily led.
So we got punished twice for things we did wrong.
Now, my wife understands but in the early years of our marriage (married 7 years but known each other 30 years) these bipolar mood swings were really hard to deal with. It's not like I can turn a switch and be without them. Now, its good. Just yesterday she raised her voice and I went into that mood. Turns out she raised her voice to get past the water pouring into a bucket!!
So for us the remedy is for me not to expect her to change eg raising her voice when she gets angry, but to reach out a little after the conflict and quietly chat about it. Then it can be over within an hour...the best I can hope for.
Tony WK Thank you for sharing your post Kazz.  It's interesting hearing of your thoughts and the journey you've had.   I think you are strong willed and incredibly self aware which can only be two traits to take with you along the way.  It's a tough illness at times.   I've had high anxiety at times with the hypomania, I used cognitive behavioural therapy to combat that, I use meditation to calm my setting when I feel edgy, I know when the irritability is surfacing. 
To be honest, I'm reluctant to chat about my 3 years on pharmacy. It's not that I don't want to give tips etc but more that I believe each persons experience is different and how they respond to treatment can vary quite a bit.  Obviously I chose to leave pharmaceuticals and try just natropath/ homeopathic , cognitive behavioural therapy and meditation because I felt thats what I'd like to do but again its individual stages and how they want to support the illness.
Thanks for sharing Kazz.

love your descriptions and this thread. Type 1 bipolar here. Years ago diagnosed with ADHD and depression. Received cousellng and meds.20 odd years of highs and lows followed. Totally irrational behaviour at times, doing everything at 100 miles an hour. Our world is completely different to normal people. The past year has been challenging to say the least.
Psych admissions , various meds, ECT treatment, hospital admissions for physical ailments , some really dark dark places, nightmares and hellish experiences. Im still here thanks to good fortune, luck, supportive family, meds are working and shining a light in a different direction in a dark room.its only in the past fortnight that I'm managing to sleep through for the first time in a year.Any minor dip for me can be drastic. I don't make too many plans. I try and get through each day.its getting a bit easier, I accept I'm different, life will be full of ups and downs. I'm learning to do moderate for the first time in my life and will be doing DBT in the near future.Its great to find others here:)
  Hi Kazzl,
probably a dumb question how did you find the support group in Canberra?
Find journaling my thoughts in a mood diary beneficial. Weeks in a elevated state , increased anxiety and irratibili try , requiring 12-15 sleep, teeth grinding after months of being in a scary scary place.im doing ok at the moment, being kind to yourself, accepting my mistakes and laughing at myself. I liken it to a big balloon full of wind and the air and preassure slowly releasing. It's 12:07 a.m here. This is the latest I've stayed up in a year.
Another positive step. One day at a time. 
 
 
 
 
  Thanks for getting back to me Kazzl,
been reflecting on the year just gone and where I'm at now. I've made progress and the time  between my visits to my mental health nurse are filled with more and more normality.im bring kind to myself and along the way learning much about what makes me tick. God it's only taken 53 years but I'm still learning.Stopped logging via my mood diary. 99% of the time I'm hyper.. Maybe 90%. I'm realising the corolation between fresh air, excercise, sound sleep , diet to  a degree which is not to good at the moment but I can pencil plans in my head in the not to distant future.Tony you are right time is an incredible healer. It's only now that I'm a semblance of my normal self. I'm now easing off my Prns meds, I accept the health issues Namelly weight gain as a side effect of the meds , but that's something I can work on.Its taken numerous hospital admissions, lots of couselling , a few close calls, luck,a loving wife and children, being here, my little dog and the resilience that we can muster time and time again when the chips are down. I was in a dark, dangerous place for a long time. A lot of it has been forgotten. I guess thats our bodies/brains protective mechanisms. I'm not out of the woods yet. I don't think I will ever be but I know I've got various treatment options and supports when and if the going gets tough.i don't think I will be around in my 80s but then again I might surprise myself. I have found out who my friends are. I only had a couple to begin with and have distanced myself from those who I just don't need in my life. I'm not as sensitive as I once was to criticism and I know I will be a work in progress until the day I cark it. It's only now that I'm beginning to sleep through. I don't have  as many work nightmares anymore, the uniform and service awards are locked away. I knew I suffered from depression, diagnosed with ADHD years ago and medicated for...I once went to buy some shoes and come back with a car but being diagnosed with Bipolar type 1 and borderline personality disorder and reading up as much as my tiny head can digest is of benefit. Posting here and spending many an hour here reading of our continuing struggles here has been beneficial.im not one for social media but this is different. It's been one hell of a year, one hell of a learning curb but as long as I'm a better person, within myself, a better husband and father well what can I say. Its worth soldiering on. Hugs alround -hope I help:) Very unpredictable though. Even the sufferer can't know how they will feel in a few hours time.
Tony one can say life with us is never dull.I shouldn't make light of the effects it has on those around us. I hate the mood shifts, the way I can snap but hopefully in time with reprogramming the brain I can change. It's all baby steps. I can change for the better, it's a matter of wanting too, being well enough to do so, accepting that there will be some rough days but also sunny days ahead.i bet your mini foxy keeps you amused.My little boy is spoilt rotten but also one of the best medicines around.Looking forward to SpringSummer and long long walks along the beach

 A therapist not too long ago said to me
I wish I could wave a magic wand and fix you but I can't. That was when I was at my lowest point. I also had a psych nurse saying that I was extremely selfish for the thoughts I was having. It was a kick in the guts at one of my low points , in hospital at the time ,totally unprofessional on her part. Needless to say I reacted to this and received an apology from the head of the psych hospital shortly after. Hi Kaz,
1963 was a good year then.can relate perfectly to you in all facets.Will look up for local bipolar support group. Am on the waiting list for DBT which from what I can gather runs for 1-2 years. I was diagnosed with Bipolar late last year and another Psych has diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder. I too have lost that blissful ignorance and spontenaiety. Constantly guarded and checking what I do.
ive had a good run lately but after a week of relative inactivity I can feel my anxiety: frustration levels slowly building up again.The weather certainly isn't helping at the moment. Winter is the pits at times.At times I need to rest and not do a thing.After months of being totally self absorbed, the Days are getting easier.Am finding any dip in mood has a dramatic effect on me.Feeling tense and sore, hopefully a very early night will be of benefit.Im on anti psychotics and antidepressants and my mental health nurse suggested mood stabilisers might be of benefit. I really don't want to take any more tablets if I can. Canberra is a lovelly place but you can have the bitter winter cold. Visitd years ago when my brother was based there.Hope you having a good one
cheers Len Hi Kaz,
hope things are on the improve... Hugs from me to you. Re DBT my psych who was treating me last year recommended DBT. I was very unwell at the time and my wife seems to think I had the initial assessment and possibly started the course but I have no recollection and a bit confused in that regard. The psych I'm seeing now recommended it and referred me to a private clinic. I received a phone call yesterday and have an 2 hour assessment next week, do an orientation in early September and commence the folowing week in a group session and also have 1 on 1 for a while as well. It seems pretty full on but I will be wiser come next week with a bit of info.... Lost my self in the garden today for a number of hours which was a  
great escape. My wife wasn't feeling well the other day and I felt completely useless in my inability to help her. With that I felt myself going downhill and thought S**t , here we go again. Being feeling ok and then wham I felt like crap.Being bipolar is a battle.Have to keep fighting it every day and never give in.
Kaz you are an inspiration,
thinking of you Len Tony and Kaz
can relate in our desire/ need to reduce our world. For every action there's a reaction .Today we dropped off our son for an overseas trip. Having to wake up early and drive in the dark resulted in me pulling over and him driving. I could feel my anxiety, feeling different and mood change in the ensuing hours. I've spent the next 8 hours in bed asleep. It's a bummer not being able to cope with everyday situations. I've made progress, great inroads given I was bed bound not so long and unable to do the most basic things. Today made me realise that I can only do so much, very little at times, given the stress and crappy existence once I overstep the mark even a little bit.At times I am so zoned out, immersed in my thoughts and oblivious to what's going on, conversations around me as a coping mechanism.if it wasn't for my wife leading the way today I wouldn't have made it to the airport, found departure lounge , remembered where the car was and made the return journey home.Its small steps but it's only been through reducing my world and tentative steps to return, often throut with anxiety, constant thoughts/battles with oneself that I'm able to get through each so called challenge. What is so easy for some is so hard for others.
Cheers Len
  Hi Kazz,
Just had 14 hours sleep. Must have needed it. Just back from seeing my mental health nurse.shes off on an overseas holiday so gave her a hug and wished her the best and to pass on thanks to her and rest of the team...
thanks is hardly enough but as they said it's a rarity to hear it. This time last year I was at my worst , in a psych hospital and at my wits end. I've come a long way. Will  ever be out of the woods ....noo I don't think so...Buts its empowering with knowledge, time, acceptance that I'm in a better place..hope you too are n a better place... Have my DBT assessment in a few days so another box ticked.. Good on you Kaz,
sounds like you are kicking a few goals.Well done. I resigned from my work last year tho the wheels fell off a few years before that.I won't be returning to the workforce again.
Must be cold in Canberra at the moment. It's wet and windy here n coastal Victoria. Is it just me ... This has been the worst Winter in a long time. This time last year I was too ill to notice and Psch hospital was very well heated.
Have my assessment tomorrow for Dbt so will be wiser...2 hours all up so I think I will be a bit mentally shagged at the end.
Last 3 days a bit of a dip n mood resulting in the need to go to bed at 7 each night and sleeping 12-14 hours and diminishing desire to do things.Gritting my teeth and feeling tense.. This rollercoaster is a pain in the ass.Anyway 
it could be far worse have a good one Kaz and it's great you have a supportive workmate who is so understanding. A rarity in this day and age but so nice tosee
cheers Len Hi Kazz,
hope you having a better day.The assessment went well. apparently I did the assessment at the start of the year, attended 1 session and then withdrew from the program. My memory of this is very vague at best.was at my darkest back them, lithium toxic and before I began my Ect treatment which has erased much.i found it pretty taxing afterwards. Bit like a delayed reaction. Requiring a few nights of 12-14 sleep beforehand and the same for a few nights since. Not helped by getting bombardment from vicsuper/amp in doing paperwork , answering questions about my depression for claim.I burnt out back in 2011, ceased full time employment, tried another career and then returned to previous field,as a casual in a lesser role and struggled to do a shift per week. Anyway the chap on the other end of the phone was understanding but had no idea.i had it all documented but he wanted to hear it from the horses mouth.So today I awoke up at 10:00, fed the dog, planned to go in the garden,shelved those plans, still in my pyjamas on the couch here on forum and olympics in the background.Kazz I dont miss the Public Sevice one bit,hope all goes well at the quacks . roll on Spring, it's a lovelly time of year. I'm a passionate gardener, spending a few hours daily when I can tidying the yard up after a year of neglect.Have a great weekend,
cheers Len Hi Loula,there are other Meds out there that your medical experts can prescribe if medication doesn't work.i ended up n hospital due to toxicity and now on other meds.i think it was due to a combination of things Namelly rapid increase n dosage, lack of fluid intake on my part and not enough monitoring by my psych.all the best with your doctors visit. Hi Loula and Kazz,
kazz has hit the nail on the head with regard to that's the depression talking.And again about communicating. I'm talking more and more to my wife as I become better.ive even given her permission to go. At times I question why she sticks with me. It's because she loves me through my ups and downs through thick and thin. It's been 31 since we walked down the aisle.And I love her. Your husband is sticking by you because he loves you and because you are worth it. Relationships are hard work.Being bipolar makes it a tad harder but we are worth it. Regarding meds I was physically sick and out of it for quite a while.To put it into context though I was very very unwell at the time. I don't like tinkering with my meds. They are prescribed and you need to take them. I know if I take extra, don't adhere to the times I pay a price am either bombed out and tired. In the perfect world we would be on no meds.But I need them and the Times I kid myself and cease taking them I crash physically and mentally. It's just a question of when.So with any changes in meds I listen to the dr and psych and take as prescribed.They take time to work and I know if they don't we will try an alternative medication. They are the experts
regards Len Hi Kazz,
hope work isn't dragging you down. Haven't heard from you in a while.you ok.?Rubber stamped for DBT.. 3 months on emotional regulation for the first part.Fully booked and I'm doing 4 hours in the evening. I'm usually bushed by the evening or flying. Anyway it's supposed to be the bees knees. Onwards and Upwards as they say
cheers Len Hi Kazz,
so sorry to hear that. Talk about when it rains it pours, hopefully one door shuts another one opens. I feel for you. I haven't worked for a year but that was a decision my wife and I made together. I'm getting over the guilt of not working. Your health is number one. I was forced into early retirement due to my bipolar, depressive episodes and so on.Work Places can be so ruthless these days. Theres no reward for loyalty these days. I hope things improve in the near future 
regards Len xx Hi Mallow and Kazz,
It has been quite on this thread. Congrats on conquering 42.1 km Mallow , I've done 3 but my running days are long gone. I used to cycle but haven't cycled since August last year when I become unwell. January 1 2017 is when I plan to get back on the pushy. Been making  radical diet choices lately in an effort to loose weight gained due to lack of excercising and side effects of the meds.
As Kazz states it's just a label. In the year since my diagnosis I've tried a couple of cocktail of meds, seen so many Psychs and now doing other theraphy in an concerted effort to get well if that's possible. It's a daily battle and I must admit it's getting easier.Lots of support here:)
cheers Len Hi Mallow and Kazz,
glad to hear things are on the improve. Enjoy the time with your daughter Kazz  families are everything. Mallow I'd love to run again. Had a hip resurface op 3 years ago and years of long distant running on hard surfaces are to blame. Back in the days of running lots and running hard. Nowadays I think there is so much info out there and short sharp interval training is the go. If running long distances rocks your boat my friend do it while you can.
very soon I will be back on my road bike. Cleaned it and my cycling gear the other day. Haven't ridden since April last year and ever so glad that I didn't sell it when I was at my lowest.They were dark days and I wouldn't have trusted myself at all out there. It will be a big step when I do but excercise, any excercise, even a short walk releases all those beautiful endorphins. Have a good one folks,
cheers Len WK,
you make so much sense. I do profess to fussing about my weight which over the years has done my head in. I've made some drastic changes, not eating red meat, potatoes, bread, skipping meals and eating only when hungry. I've lost little weight and realise that if we're to eat more frequent as in 5 small meals, I'd provably kick start my metabolism and loose weight a bit more sensibly.
MallowPuff I used to get colds and feel run down pardon the pun post my marathons. They take so much out of you and it's important to take it easy so you can bounce back better for the next one. It's been 17 years since I ran that distance so my advice might be old hat lol.
i actually fired up my spin bike yesterday. Took it very easy, but it was great to feel the blood pumping and my heart pounding out of my chest.With some weather in the 30s (yay and about bloody time we had some sunny wether) I plan to don the Lycra and hit the road. So much has changed this year, I'm getting my mojo back . Amazing what the right meds, medical intervention, supportive family and great support here on BB from some beautiful , special people. It just goes to show what a bit of tenacity will do. I see the quack tomorow regarding my 6 month follow up post DVT. I know following the scan the other day something is slightly ammiss but will soldier on. 
Kazz, haven't forgotten about you my friend, hope you had some magic quality time with your daughter,
cheers all  Congratulations Kaz,
see one door shuts another one opens. Fantastic news on the job front well done.Makes perfect sense to me as well. You can wear a different pair every day. Half price as well and there's nothing like a bit of retail theraphy. F the public service as well. My sons 21 birthday today so proud as punch. It's a warm one here today 31 degrees. It's come out of nowhere and 22 tomorrow. Typical of the weather this year bit like me all over the place lol. Actually doing ok.My course ,meds and one on ones seems to be working. Living "normally " if such a thing for me exists. Having been on the bike yet. Today was supposed to be the day buts its way to Hot. The specialist on Monday advised me that my main artery in my leg is still blocked but the other veins are working and he's happy. I'm also to ride with caution as if I have a fall I will bleed out.its like riding without a helmet. My reckoning is that if I fall or collide with a car will come off second best anyway. Have always been a defensive cyclist anyway. It's all good though. I m still here.i m rapt for you Kazz following your passion and following a career choice much more befitting. Hope it's sunny in your neck of the woods
cheers Len Kazz,
what a bunch of tosses that mob were. Take care and thinking of you. Keep on keeping on, one foot in front of the other and you can do it in any pair of shoes you choose,
mega hugs Len Hello Kazz,
supposed to be Summer and I've the heater on and it's raining and ever so windy out there. I do so hate the wind. Hope it's better in your neck of the woods. I'm having a bit of CBA myself. Couple of very early nights and a bit of self medication. Taking the break I need I guess. I try and ride my bike at least twice a week or walk the dog or do something physical most days. Still not eating red meat, potatoes and bread which is starting to reflect on the scales.One more week of Dbt then it's the Xmas break. I've managed to attend all 12 weekly sessions and my one on ones so that's a big tick for me.
Kazz that sounds like interesting reading I must admit I struggle with the stuff I get with my course but I continue to learn and it's helping. How are those new shoes going.?Doing anymore retail theraphy? I've a harmonica on the bench gathering dust lol. One day I will get back into it. Gees I hope this weather warms up and we have some consistent warm to hot days. Nothing to drastic . I'd be happy for  run of endless mid twenties and no wind, sheer bliss with the sun on your back as you potter around.
Kazz it's good to see you being kind to yourself after a day of doing very little. I too used to beat myself after such a day. I'm learning to be kind to myself, finding the middle ground and not going to the extremes. I still have my days, sometimes a run of them when I've been slammed but thankfully not as often. I hope you are having a good one my friend,
hugs Len Hi Kazz, ms purple,mallow and Source shield,
what a bunch of talented folk we are. Once there was BB King and now there's the BP's . I dabbled with clarinet in year 7. There wasn't much to choose from lol. Hey Kazz if you get a chance there's a great Tom Petty documentary on Net Flix , well worth watching and apart from the great music , he was a man of his principles. Great admiration for him and learnt so much. Mad Beatles fan here, love the Eagles, Fleetwood Mac and just about anything else. Having 2 older sisters I was exposed to a wide array of music. One was a mad Bay City Rollers fan, but we won't go there lol.
when I'm being the domestic God nothing better then putting on YouTube hits from yesteryear. Apart from the bloody ad breaks I can turn it right up,sing along as I tear around. Mix it up a bit , last week Linda Ronstad kept me entertained for a few hours.
ive had some very early nights this week. 3 and 4 o'clock I've popped my pills and hit the sack. 15 hours of sleep. Just bunkering down when need be.
Yesterday walked for a few hours with my pooch, cycled for a hour and a half and gardened a wee bit. Overdid it, but an easier day today. Hard to believe Xmas around the corner. It's getting very busy,
keep on practicing folks together we can make some beautiful music together
cheers Len Hi Kazz,
greetings from down South. I love the humour in your posts - a bipolar lead recovery lol.ive been busy a rowing machine and bench gym thingy yesterday.. Not cheap ones either .. Commercial grade stuff that I will use. Not a week goes by when I'm not buying something that I need. My wife God bless her is very understanding. Been keeping very busy which is good for me . Excercise long walks and making the most of day light saving. I'm in a good place at the moment.The stars or planets have finally aligned. This could all change overnight of course but will make the most of it when it happens. Hope Xmas and New Year are absolutely magic for you. If I could play you  tune on my harmonica I would but will give it a burl. Have a good one  mega hugs Len xx Hi Kazz,
read something in the paper the other day regarding the benefits of gardening in beating depression. Breathing in the soil or words to that effect. I'm a mad gardener as well. Starting a veggie patch, just starting the beds, and a few days back purchased a flow through worm bin so it's all good for the garden. Can relate regarding loosing interest in things ... Must be a bipolar thing. The constant need for something new. I always been an excercise nut but only now I'm doing it in moderation. Just going to sister in laws for Xmas. It's going to be a warm one. About time but it will be a shock to the system. Keep your plants and yourself hydrated. Mineral water, slice of lemon or lime with fresh mint for me ,
cheers Len xox  Hello Mallow Puff,Dottie, Kaz and Tony,
hard to believe it's 2017. No New Years resolutions for me just grateful I made it through the most challenging year of my life.
ive had  deep and meaningful with my wife regarding getting off my meds. She reminded me that the reason why I'm well and stable at the moment is due to the right meds, counselling and ongoing theraphy. I would have to stay in the psych hospital to monitor my condition a and deep down I know I'm not ready. Anyway will see what my psych says. She's the expert and will be guided by her. Keeping busy gardening , excercising , I need those endorphins.The other day i rowed on my rower for 90 minutes , went for a long long walk with my pooch and had a walk with my wife in the morning. I over did it, struggled to sleep and it's taken me days to recover.Buying stuff on EBay, hardware shop. Not a week goes by when I'm not indulging in some retail therapy for myself. Not having the high highs or low lows at the moment but impulsive as.Survived Xmas and New year. Accepting my condition a bit more these days and my lot in life. It was a bummer last year. One of the positives was the wealth of support here. RIP Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. Tragic to say the least.
hope you are having a good one folks 
cheers Len Hi Kazz,
your garden sounds idyllic.  It's great theraphy I think. You know a water feature is very therapeutic as well. Yeah I know without those meds I'd be a mess and have been even when medicated so it's been a combination of a lot of things that's keeping me well.
im pretty stuffed when I overdo the excercise thing. Its takes days to recover. Going to bed at 4 in the arvo. Struggle with moderation but I'm learning. You makes lots of sense.i know what it's like to feel out of kilter. A stranger in the crowd that sort of thing. I'm managing and managing to stay out of hospital and having those dark dark thoughts and I don't want to go back there.
so what have you planted in your cottage garden. I imagine the conditions in Canberra must be favourable though you have snow on those hills. I'm a Bunnings fan as well.
My garden is full of Native plants. I'm starting a couple of veggie patches. Very sandy soil down here but lots of horse poo and mushroom compost and time will fix that. I've also dabbling into vermiculture or worm farming so turning into a real greenie. Plan to grow some of the weird varieties and old fashioned veggies out there.Being bipolar we always do things differently lol.its good to string more and more periods of for want of a better word normality. I know I will never be normal again but then again I never was.
My diagnosis, the right meds, family and medical support and not throwing the towel in have made me what I am today. Self care is a big thing and a continual learning process,
glad you are here and doing well:)
cheers Len Hi there Dottie, Kazz and MallowPuff,
Dottie I love your posts. Another vote for your cheery visits and I hope 2017 is a good one for you too!
Kazz you garden sounds like magic. Not a day goes by when I'm not in mine. It's a proven fact that tinkering around with the soil is good for the soul.
Mallow sounds like you have a green thumb as well. Good on you and it's great that your 8 year old is tagging along. A 28 k trail run, just makes me tired thinking about it. I've had a hip resurface, number of knee scrapes which I can attribute to lots of long distant running in my 20- 40s. Man I'm paying for it now. I cycle but only for a little while, row on my machine and finally lifting some light weights that have been gathering dust for years.
ive always been addicted to excecise, food, something.its all or nothing in the past and finally my 'moderation' now is an hours xcecise most days and lots of sleep. I've never needed rest so much as since my meds, treatment and the rollercoaster that was last year.im lucky to be here and I will leave it at that. That's a medicated me I like that, so true as much as I hate the array of tablets I consume each night , the alternative is not pleasant.
Mallow when you are ready you can get back into it.short walks are great, walking laps at the pool, even swimming if you can. From the time I was really ill it took me 18 months to get back into excercise. Some days I do nothing. If I need to go to bed at 3 in the Arvo I do. Most nights I'm in bed by 8:30. I try and do whatever it takes to get through each day.
its great to touch base with so many genuine souls here.
cheers Len Hello All,
An unquite mind sounds like a good read. It's been ages since I read a book.Kazz yeah I know I sound like some sort of fitness junky, but I used to smoke, a carton whilst on holidays and then stop, even rocked up at a fun run with a cig in my mouth and then run a PB.. It's been years since I had a fag or smoked constantly but when stressed would go through a couple of packs a day and then not smoke for a year or 2. All my life I've been the extremes. Guess never a dull moment with us hey . As for shopping, I'm doing retail theraphy constantly. Purchased some goggles and snorkel via eBay today for upcoming cruise, yesterday some sports mats for upstairs and day before a ph monitor for the garden. Small things but it all adds up. My rowing machine and bench were not cheap. Luckily my wife is pretty understanding.
Awfully hot here this morning, raining now and temperature drop with it. Bloody Victorian weather.Was on my hands and knees picking up and raking gum leaves on my nature strip.
ive figured if I concentrate on a given section of the garden on each day week in , week out I will be on top of the garden, gives me some structure and allows me to get some excercise in. Dumb me went for a bike ride on consecutive days. Apart from almost getting collected by a car, I was totally totally stuffed today, didn't sleep well overnight and crappy dreams.
Continuing to learn what I can and cannot do.
Hey there Mallow it's a bit of a clique but hopefully more come on board. It's hard to be eberywhere but not from lack of trying lol. Shocking , Shocking scenes in Melbourne. Having worked in  justice department for 20 odd years our system is in dire need of overhaul. I avoid watching the news or reading the paper anymore. 
I know if I stay up , take my meds late, I'm pooped the next day and in a fog. Nowadays I'm usually in by 9:00 pm and occasionally crash or have a na na nap mid arvo. I used to be up before dawn, years on end, rotating shifts , 24/7 but now I'm rarely awake before 9 am and by nights end I need sleep, lots of it , clenching my teeth and despite my excercise and trying to keep busy rarely wake up rested. Bed is my friend, comfort zone but it can be my hell as well.
Dottie, hope all is well. Your posts are a breath of fresh air. As for films we always watch Love Actually around Xmas. Every time we watch it we see simething new. I love my music, same vintage as Kazz so much to say so little room.....run out of room and retyped(
by
  Back again
typing o n iPad is frustrating at times. It's raining, my frogs croaking rather loudly from my pond and thankgod the change has come. I've turned into a real old fart in the last few years.Last year knocked me for six.Luckily it's 2017 and determined to make the most of it. 
its amaysing how being here, posting, hopefully helping others and being helped yourself is all part of the recovery process.I thinks we deserve to give ourselves a collective hug and pat on the back. 
Keep on keeping on folks
cheers Len xox Hi Mallow,
i used to love playing pinball machines. Closest thing these days is PinBall Arcade on the IPad but I deleted the App. Also loved SpaceInvaders, Galaga  and was into Doom ages ago. 
I used to love a good book but struggle to grasp anything these days .Doing a cruise in a few months. I'd love to read an unusual mind or the book by Carrie Fischer to obtain more insight but might leave it till we get back.
cheers Len Hi folks,
Dottie you are a breath of fresh air. Glad to find you in a good headspace and feeling ok.Nosy, obnoxious and high maintenance, don't change a thing. Well worth it.Sounds like you in your last year then? I know timetables stuffed my boys around. One has finished , might do honours but would much prefer to land a job. My other son has 1 year to go, suffers from anxiety and is thankfully seeking professional help.My wife and my boys are my  world.. Meds thank god for them. They are certainly costing a pretty penny, my problem is I'm taking them all at once. Last night , stayed up late,no excercise and all my meds and I had some vivid vivid dreams, scary stuff but only myself to blame.
Mallow, some people get the rough end of the stick.Life can be so cruel at times but modern medicine can do wonders. I mean look at us.
Kazz 1963 was a good yearear, I m an Airies Btw but some shuteye works wonders.Dottie was right,once again in proclaiming you the resident sleeping beauty.Your volunteer work sounds so rewarding , I used to do respite in between career change before it all went to crap and found it so rewarding and an eye opener. Will be cruising the South Pacific, great fun, value for money and did I mention the food , to die for,
Well folks it's 09:03 , Roger F is doing it easy in the tennis, going take my meds and hopefully have a blissful sleep,
see yu on the other side
Lenxox Hi folks,
Dottie half way there.my son tells me double degrees are common. Hats off for you.2 years is nothing in the scheme of things. As for being a supportive dad, I try but my wife is the sensible one in the relationship. She is the family rock.
Last night I slept well, no dreams, it's a daily battle.ive discovered your thread and glad you are here.Hoping you had a cruisy day and have a good one tomorow . Cruising is the bees knees. Waking up each day in a new port in your floating hotel. One of the islands is totally deserted except for the ships visit, idyllic to say the least,
Have a good one hugs Len Hello All,
Welcome aboard Ivan, im also 53 and diagnosed bipolar type 1 about 14 months ago. Have tried various meds to find the right mix, had numerous hospital admissions, ect treatment and to say I was in a bad place is an understatement. Since April last year I haven't been in hospital. I've clawed my way out of hell through professional support, family support, proper diagnosis and an acceptance on my part. I've ceased friendships, taken the necessary steps to be in a good place more often than not. Next week I see my psych for the first time in months. I think she will be pleasantly surprised. I'd love to be medication free, I really would but I'm scared to try and to be brutally honest I'd be stupid to try. I don't want to revisit that dark dark place again.i don't think I could do again. Before this diagnosis I suffered from depression for majority of my life and diagnosed with ADHD for 20 years. 
Great bunch of supportive people here. They truly are. Great Australian Day today. Went to the flicks and watched LaLa Land. Pleasantly surprised and well worth watching. I danced out of the cinema,
tomorrow s another day
cheers Len Hi folks, regulars and welcome aboard newcomers,
Kazz what great news re scholarship and the new job. Wow you will be busy as. I've walked for a few hours, rowed on my machine for an hour and done up teen stomache crunch Es. I've discovered an ap called zero where you log you last meal, based on intermitant fasting with the goal of not eating for 13 hours with the hope of getting rI'd of some weight. There's some science too it . 
Love the name LadyDust.Weve all different stories but we supportive here. Since being on meds I can't even have 1 glass of alcohol . It just doesn't agree with me. I was never a big drinker so I've brought a soda stream so mineral/soda  water is one of my new vices.
Lady_Stardust, I hope to remain sort of level for the foreseeable future with meds, couselling and hardwork.The extremes I have endured in the recent past were scary.
Echo Kazzs sentiments with best of luck of finding a job. I was very high functioning and career minded for close to 25 years. My diagnosis explained a lot to me, I'm good for the moment and hopefully it lasts a while. I have a few side effects with my meds, would love to be off them, but the benefits far outweigh not taking them. I'm Bipolar but I'm also a lot of other things as well.Join the gang here, we bounce off each other and ride the rocky rollercoaster together,
cheers Len Mindfullness has helped me no end. Each session of DBT starts with a session.just another tool in the ever expanding toolbox,
cheers Len .Happy Monday folks,
resilience I love my music either working out , doing housework or loud in the car with the sunroof off. Must be a frustrated drummer as I'm always finger tapping
lady _stardust all the best with your job hunting. My job these days is gardening, housework, excercise and start the New Year with DBT. 
Dottie​ how did you pull up after the party?So glad you,post here, you have amaysing insight for someone so young, a wise head upon your shoulders and the exilerance of youth- hope I don't offend you .
Na Kaz didn't watch the tennis completely , flicking between the Tennis, Im a celebrity and I think Master Chef and Marriage shows start tonight., so will tape some and my wife will have to prioritise lol. I'm usually done and dusted by 9ish anyway.
Mallow how's the excercise going? Take it easy in the heat. My stomache is sore from too many stomache crunches that will teach me.
Ivan country resort sounds idyllic, what part of the country did you visit? Sounds like you on the right track and reading the conditions in regards to bipolar.Gym is good. Have a few weights, spin bike, bench press, and a concept 2 rower updtairs. I need excercise to take the edge off.
Hii 1113 good you see your body as a temple. When younger I was ok with mine, but now I see lots of faults. It wasn't so long ago that I couldn't even look in the mirror but I was pretty sick then. I've only got about 7 kgs more to loose and I've given myself the rest of the year to do it. 
Hi to all others as well. I find an iPad not the most user friendly thing to type on. I just discovered the B button

hopefully Paul finds this DBT is Dialectical Behavioural Theraphy group for participants with Borderline Personality Disorder, self harming behaviours and or /long term trauma issues. Also develops emotional regulation and distress tolerance skills. Individual sessions to support skill development also provided.usually runs for a year spread over 3 core modules, option of repeating it and graduate program.
Have just finished Emotional Regulation module in Dec 2016, begin Interpersonal Effectiveness in a few weeks and final module is Distress Tolerance. It does my head in at times, I feel so dumb but I'm not. It was developed by an American Marshha M​. Lineham who if you google and YouTube will explain the ins and outs of the course and her own personal battle. I'm finding it very beneficial, attended all sessions and 1 on 1 weekly sessions with clinician helped :) Oops ran out of room . I ramble abit at times.
velvet faerie 
excercise has always been my positive addiction. I need it even more so now.ive got it in my head that I need 1.5 hours per day minimum. I either cycle, walk the dog,row and sometimes a combination of a few of them.. 
When I was younger I ran a few marathons, now I can't run, dicky knees and hip resurface,
until I was ill I would cycle 100-250 ks   a week. I didn't cycle or excercise for over a year, I've clawed my way of the couch , now walk 10ks, cycle 38 ks 2-3 times a week and row 10 ks with some light weight training and a restricted diet. That's my warped view on Moderation these days. I think I will go a bit stir crazy come Winter but have no excuses,
hope work flies my friend 
cheers Len Hello folks,
how we doing? What a wonderful gang we have here.  A diverse range of ages and backgrounds and we are abuzz. as a kid I used to run around with a bug catcher, plastic thingy for catching insects and mucked around with a microscope as well. Dorky kid who was alergic to bees and stung every year.  My study days are behind me but DBT will be enough for my wee brain. Such a clever dick today , cleaning my row machine, pulled and tried to secure handle behind a chair end result handle flying through the air and end result busted screen:( ...won't be doing that again needless to say an expensive excecise.
Visitd my psych today, heart to heart discussion about reducing Some of my meds...staying on ADs for good and gradual reduction of some of the others.. Rapt with the progress I've made and she believes some of the meds are making the real issues.i actually ran out of my PRNs last night, survived ok, hence the discussion.Early days but progress.
Kazz before you know it you will be part of the furniture. It's only natural to be a tad apprehensive in any new situation yet alone a new work environment.
Chae keep on chipping away, something will come up. Rejection in any form is a bummer and I know that I tend to take any form of rejection harder then most. It's part of my makeup  but one of the msny things I'm trying to change.
i need to sleep. Take a few happy pills,
cheers hugs Len
  Hi Mallow 
8 k run around the zoo, sounds idyllic and there's some lovelly parkland there. A very green vibrant part of the city. No excercise for me today funeral and my mums birthday she passed away 5 years ago.Payed respects and grateful to see a few old family friends.
Velvetfaery that's a great excuse for being late for work. No mean feat in capturing a goat in full flight , scary things
Lady_Stardust ​proud of you as well. Some people have no tact or consideration in regards to how cutting their remarks can be. I'm slowly regaining a thick skin or trying too on any day some remarks cut deep. A cyber hug from a fellow sufferer and hope your mood gets better I'm sure it will.
My first job was in TAFE , Fond memories and TAFE like many industries was in full flight in the 1980,s one could say in the good old days.
Dottie it's only money, one comes into the world with nothing and leaves the world with nothing that's something I heard today.The tech rang and the screen sounds promptly stuffed so a newer upgrade will have a few more bells and wistles, like Hearth rate, Bluetooth.As much as I m trying to simplify my life I do love a new gadget, I also need to cut back on purchases I think it's a bipolar thing, impulsiveness one never knows what one will do.
i too am extremelly familiar with sad., been very sad , sad at the Wong times, politically incorrect  at other times.. Someone today described me as always being happy.. I open ed up about the last year, no shame in opening up about being biplolar and hues to show how we can ,mask things. You come across as a happy, very giving soul via the written word and hope th is brings a smile to your dial.its great that you are here !! we are weird in a wonderful way.
it would be rather dull without us wouldn't it?
Kazz big steps and well done. That's fantastic news, sounds like you are recharging the batteries . I must profess to having many an afternoon nap even long periods of being bed bound when I was really struggling.  I need my sleep, I tend to zone out a bit with the meds but have noticed that with ceasing/cutting back on the meds the last few days I'm a bit more hyper in a good way and waking up before 8am and alert.Not looking forward to Winter, suffer the Winter blues big time, hopefully by then learning more and more techniques and coping better.one thing I can be assured of is of many friends here.As a learned scholar once said I hope you are all doing alright or alrightish if struggling

 Hi Kazz,
Totally agree on a tall and elegant bookcase ,
maybe Victorian Ash, cedar or Maple.Lets see certainly well read and going back to my Library days 150 Psychology, 641.994 you'd find something on Australian Cooking, 700s are the Arts , Literature in the 800s and a bit of Aussi History around the 994. Nothing like a good read is there.
Hopfully as I continue to improve, I will have another fortitude to pick up a good book and read it from cover to cover, 
Any ideas?
cheers Len xix
 
  Hi folks,
Dottie sounds like you need a hot cup of hot lemon juice. My mum used to swear by it when I was a little kid. LemSip is very similar. Hope that the meds have kicked in. Lie Low, rest and I think the weather going to take a downhill turn over the weekend.
i love your pearls of wisdom . There's nothing like a ray of sunshine and a bit of blue sky to cheer one up. I know I need a daily dose. I am not looking forward to Winter:( but that's a while away yet. 
Cheers Len Dottie,
Let me wipe your tears away if that's ok. Good to see you looking forward to uni. Bummer you feeling super down. It's the pits please accept my cyber hug. Uni will be somewhat of a distraction. We moved my youngest to uni the other week and the house is so empty:(.   
Bit indifferent in my neck of the woods. Change in medication has resulted in me being a bit more with it but flat and slightly unsettled as well. Excercise levels have fluctuated. Can 1 pill make such a difference. My psych also  wants me to keep daily excecise and food intake log in case something is missing.Still losing weight which is a good thing. Thankfully a warm one tomorow I do love the Suns rays on my back. Not looking forward to Winter at all.I wish I could wave a magic wand and collectively cure all of us. If only it was that simple.
Kaz sounds like you been super busy. Hope you rest when you can.
 Chae, Velvet Fairy and Mallow Puff sounds like you are all excercising which is good. I forced myself to take a rest day yesterday. You'd think someone of my vintage would know better. Some days a walk, bike ride isn't enough to take the edge of.
Im accepting of my bipolar diagnosis , at times a blessing, at times a curse. I know I'm different , can at times laugh at myself, struggle nowadays to cry and it's a bit of a prick. I'm not the only one with a mental illness. It's great how we support one another here. Hope you all doing ok and doing whatever it takes to remain so
cheers Len xox
​ Mega hugs and virtual hugs to all concerned.Dottie I'm glad I cheered you up a wee bit. :) You are so deserving.Saw my youngest today briefly. He's knee deep helping with O week but it was good to see him well.Chae can relate to the crankiness. I'm cranky have no real reason to be so but lately all is not well. I'd love to cry but I struggle to these days. Can get emotional at the oddest things and then not cry or be emotionally numb when I should. Guess that comes with being NQR as a person. At least I can laugh at myself at times.  I know I can reach out here and it's so gratifying when feeling blue or on top of the world finding and helping others here or in turn getting help, virtual hugs and reassurances here,
glad we can lean on one another here as we likeminded souls have so much in ccommon,
hugs Len Hi folks,
hope you all on the improve. Accepting mega hugs and reciprocating to you as needed. Bit of a weird week for me. Gone back to my previous dosage as the reduction at m request hadn't gone well. Was manic and you think one little pill would make such a difference. Far more settled,  a bit more sedate and bombed out as a result but that's the way it's going to have to be for me. Was feeling a tad vulnerable and thinking here we go again. Was not the best headspace especially with upcoming cruise. It's been a bit unsettling and came close to readmittance to hospital but didn't.
Still excercysing but taking the gas off. The odd rest day, no longer doing twice a day workouts and allowing the odd indulgence food wise. Had a good talk with my psych and come up with a plan to cope over the next few weeks.,once upon a time I could take most things in my stride but not anymore. At least I can see the warning signs in advance and nip things in the bud.Will look after myself. Catch you all soon
 cheers Len  Hey there beautiful people,
just back from my stint on the bridge. I survived my holiday.It was ok, had some rough moments, missed a few days in my cabin, increased my meds before the trip. My experiment with my Drs go ahead didn't go well. I won't do that again in a hurry and have hooked to see my psych this week given the seesaw it has been.
Dottie , as Captain Kazz says and I second it as well you are a ray of sunshine here. Kazz has articulated it perfectly. I hope you seek help advice if the thoughts return. I can hardly offer advice as I wasn't in the best head space at times during the cruise hence the increase in my meds and early psych appointment. Take care my special friends. We can all lean on one another and help  and assist when the going gets rough ,
hugs Len xox Hi Cazz and Issi,
welcome to the bipolar gang. I was diagnosed BP type 1 In 2015. Numerous hospital admissions, various psychs and meds till something worked. I'm doing DBT which is helping another tool in the toolbox. It's been a pretty hellish year or so but I'm having more and more good moments. Every day brings something new. I tried backing off my meds and it didn't work out.  I now know I I'll take this assorted cocktail of meds for the remainder of my life. Supportive lot here , we have so much in common. 
I need lots of excercise, right diet and sleep on any given day for some sense of normality. It is a daily battle but I'm a lot better then what I was,
cheers LenM Hi Issi,
thats great news. I had a good dose of ECT treatment as it had worked for my mother. At 1 stage 3 a week, and then maintenance  for a week. About 18 all up, dreadful headaches, short term memory loss ( tho I've forgotten big chunks of my life) and lots of flashbacks and focus on my younger years. It's been a year since my last round and the important thing is little by little , step by step it's working. Many a time I guess I've been dancing on the edge, but I step back. I'm still here, extremelly grateful for all the help I've received and so much out of my comfort zone.
Velvetfaerie, 
had a rest day yesterday, you've motivated me to spend some time upstairs on my rowing machine and lift some weights. I'm finding I need it more and more. Have a great one folks,
cheers Len Hello All,
a day to celebrate us. Just goes to show  the advances in mental health tho theirs a long way to go. Not having a good one. Can't seem to be to do anything right today and it's affecting my mood :(  so no one xcecise, gardening or much today. An easy day in the context of things but a hard one.
cheers and hugs LenM Hi quirky words,
yes pic of my dog, rather befitting the black dog. One of the reasons why i,picked him. He is always there as pets are. Hi there Mallow must go to the dentist one day myself. Been gritting my teeth and paying the price. Have a good one folks. Need some excecise to get the endorphins flying cheers
Lm Hi Velvetfaerie and others,
thoughts, hugs, high fives and stuff all round. Not much happening in my neck of the woods. Struggling with constant fatigue so having a day off from excercise. It's a magic Autumn week in Melbourne. I get so affected by the weather. Mood fluctuates as well. Some extra meds for a good nights sleep ,
cheers LenM Hi there folks,
sounds like a good workplace balance Velvetfaerie. Something I struggled with. You got a birthday coming up. Me too, over Easter, might even have a chocolate or 2. The weather has turned here in Vic. Wet and cold. I love the warmer weather. Good week of excercise for me last week. Indoor rowing session for me and loosing more weight yippee! 10 more Kgs and I will be the weight that I was when in early20s and felt bombproof. Burnt another long term friendship for good last week. I'm ok with that. My world is so small these days, some people just don't get mental health. Constant questioning no more. Hope we all having a good one wherever you are ,
cheers and mega hugs LenM  Hi quirky words,
my goal weight is wishful thinking.If I get there and stay there good if not will have to be satisfied. My current weight is ok.,Have lost 20 kgs and my body is saying thanks, I excercise  most days @ 1.5 hours minimum and sometimes that's not enough to get a sense of balance.whatever that is lol.
im, not adverse to poking around op shops as well. Always a bargain to be had and always searching for something, ops shops, gum tree or eBay.
How are you doing Dottie, how's uni going?
Issi hope TMS is working. Was going to try that if ECT didn't.
Mallow , how's the excecise going? My left knee has blown up a bit grinding the big chain wheel on my bike. Slow to realise that I'm not a spring chicken anymore.
ive done a bit of CBT it rings a bell. Into second module of DBT which has been helpful.
Kazz how are you doing my friend. Hope you and all have a happy Easter and a decent break from it all. I might indulge in some high quality dark chocolate with no caffeine headaches hopefully afterwards
 cheers LenM Hi folks,
yep a big one for retail theraphy, EBay, GumTree constantly looking. I'm redoing my garden fetish. Keeps me busy. Not a morning person, used to be up @ 5 am out of necessity for work. These days 0900 am, breaky, fruit @ 12-2 if I'm hungry, eat veggies by 5, meds by 8 and in bed by 0900 pm. It's become a bloody ritual. 
Im tired haven't excercised for a couple of days, feeling a bit flat but doing ok.
tattoos had one done about 5 years back. Means a lot to me.Regarding aniversarys just over 2 years since i almost dissapeared. I've danced on the edge a few times since and slowly step by step learning the steps to move forward.
ive become very regimented in my old age lol, almost sickenly so, my spontenaiety has gone since my medicated bliss. Excercise is a drug for me. Always has been but I need it so much  these days. Can't really do alcohol anymore and eat a low carb , clean diet.
I know I'll will never be alright, always a bit different, battling my demons, but I'm so so lucky to be here still. Taking part in a bipolar study this week, bone density, shit loads of questions but hopefully by taking part it will help further understand what we have. 
Gods gift to the medical profession I am. Have a great Easter people,Megahugs LenM Hi velvetfaerie,
awake at 4. I'm usually in the midst of a nightmarish dream at that time. My meds have me having the most scariest , realistic dreams. Hard to define reality or not. I'm slowly building up to something don't know what sore joints, feeling flat, migraines most evenings and now this morning.Might take a decent break from excercise , recharge . Take care hugs :) Hi there Velvetfaerie,
love your waffle by the way. Waffle on I say. Re melatonin I get my online from biovea Australia far cheaper then what chemists sting you. It works for me. I'm glad you are on the mend. possibly another episode for me. Just slight things happening which become huge to me. Hope the anxiety improves. Take care and thanks for the kind words. Same for you. Hope you have a good one
cheers LenM Hi Kazz,
from one old hand to another . I hear you. If I need to might go,in for a short stay for a reboot. Been suggested and something to seek. Will see. Lots of support around as well as here :) cheers 
Len Hi there DimityRose,
hope I got that right , welcome aboard. I'm constantly buying stuff. eBay is my friend. How do I explain.? Well if buy some plants if I'm going through my plant phase I need to buy plants, pit's, fertilysers by the dozen then it's something else. It's relentless. Do I need it? Really I think so lol. And I'm well at the moment , not high or manic or extremes thanks to the right  meds , counselling and lots of theraphy. Snacks yep loved chocolates, donuts, Chips all the naughty things and then go spastic on excercise, then fight th scales. Went of for years.
Happy 40th Mallow you young thing. My 54th was last week. I'm the fittest I've been for years. Had to take a week off as my knees were protesting. Now I'm turning the small cogs on my bike. Gotta watch my cadence. I need excercise so so badly. I have to do it smartly these days.
Kazz might have to check out the bipolar support group down the track . Finding DBT great and will redo it to further protect myself. In a good space . Wish I good bottle what's working and take it day in day out.
Carlton got flogged big time. Doubt very much if I will see another premiership in my lifetime. Wasn't that long ago when winning premierships were the norm. Where has the time gone?
 cheers all
LenM Hey Dimyrose,
broke out the snacks, dark chocolate and chips. Headache to follow. Love my sleep, but getting to sleep and scary nightmares are a given these days. You can do it you know when you are ready. I've had my junk fix and it wasn't enjoyable. Hope your headache passes quickly,
cheers Len Hi Possum,
early days for you.Glad your meds are helping , sorry to hear about your mother.Regarding moods don't know I'm not extremes touch wood now but who knows what tomorrow brings. Currently the hellish of all headaches caused by chocolate rush and junk food, self inflicted and only myself to blame. This is a fantastic forum and all the Bipolars and not bounce off one another. Hope we can help and support you here as I have found here
hope you accept my welcome hug Len Hi folks,
its cold and wet here and last we got slammed by the rain. I was daiagnised about 1.5 years ago. About 20 years ago it was ADHD and depression. 20 + years of working in a high stress environment, first responder stuff accounts for a bit of PTSD. Lots of highs and lows in my life but I keep on bouncing back. I think there is still a stigma attached to mental illness and a lot of people just don't get it . I've cut those people out of my life. You certainly find out who your friends are.
I'm rapt that I'm still here. Lucky to have a supportive wife and wonderful children.
Quirkywords I love the photo in your profile.Theres a wide range of ages here, a couple of old heads and a sprinkling of the new breed. We've been through a lot, will continue to do so and shake off the bad shit when we can. im glad to have found a bunch of people who just get it. Beyond Blue is a fantastic avenue to do this and hats off to Jeff Kennett for kicking it along a few years ago.
Great Day for Anzac cookies. I've been good today. My migraine has gone. It was the chockies and chips.  My body can't handle stuff like that anymore.:) 
Kazz your other half will be back before you know it. It's cold here in southern vic it won't be long before there's snow up on the Mountans near you. Stay warm
cheers Len Hi Kazz and the rest of the gang,
great to hear that the other half is back.,Gets lonely otherwise.,Sounds like work is keeping you really busy. Reassuring to hear a fellow workmate gets it. Rare as hens teeth. Been busy potering around the veggie garden . I'm at my best outdoors keeping busy. Excercising when I can. A gentle 15 k row on my rowing machine yesterday ticked the box. Wanted to ride today but my bike had a rare flat so cleaned the bike , changed the tube and their always tomorow. My weight s stable as well with careful eating so I'm learning moderation. For all the mothers have a good one. Will be lighting a candle for mine. I miss her so.
As for Eurovision didn't ABBA win it back in the 1970s. We were robbed last year or the year before.
im doing pretty good at the moment , grateful for a lot of things one of them being here,
hugs people's 
Len  Take a breather Kazz,
hugs Len Big wave back to all,
quirkywords I don't know what the answer is . I'm on a cocktail of Meds which for the time being are keeping me well. I'm tired. Most nights I sleep 12 hours but not refreshed as the dreams/nightmares have an affect . Each night is like some magic carpet ride into the unknown or horrific work related dreams A bit of PTSD. I try and excercise most days, mainly to take the time edge of as I've excercised all my life. But I can't do it like I used to. Went for a longer ride the other day, got a puncture in the dark and walked home 4 ks in bare feet. Stupid really and cyclists and cars don't mix too well. Felt very vulnerable and this  was a regular ride I used  to do with ease. I'm fit but not comfortable on roads nowdays with no bicycle lane. Thank my meds and advancing years. Yesterday as a result massive headache migraine thanks to previous day's experience and managed a 10 k row on my rowing machine. I still feel tired but not tired of life as I once was not so long ago. Listen to your body, sometimes I used to do nothing and wouldn't and still won't hesitate to spend a day in bed.Most days I keep busy farting around which helps keeps the demons at bay. I know they will rear their ugly head again but hopefully have learned the coping strategies to help. On that note will take my meds and be in bed @ 8:10 pm,
cheers and hugs all :) Sleep,
went to bed @ 4 pm. It's been ages since I've done that. 12 hours is what I need.Doesnt matter how much I sleep I'm never refreshed o bouncing out of bed like I used to. Usually takes a few hours to get going. Only excercise after midday when Im more alert. Haven't excercised for a few days tired.Had some weird dreams last night. My dreams/nightmares are real realistic I think due to my meds. I really experience them. Hard to differentiate real or not. Last nights I was actually talking to my wife and saying I'm not dreaming this is real but in reality I was in la la land and then before getting out at bed at 8: am I spent quite a few minutes watching blue purple shapes twirling around when my eyes were shut. Some sort of weird trip lol.Tonight will be another adventure. I'm told by higher authorities that's it's one of the side effects. Perfectly legal lol but all jokes aside scary more often then not. I briefly reduced my meds a while back with the OK, from my psych. Not a good experience for me back on the same dose and not in a hurry to try again. Each case is different and be guided by the experts. Have a good one folks
cheers Len
 Hi Issi,
you hit the nail on the head 👍On the subject of meds prescribed something new due to the nightmareish dreams I have as a result of my meds. If I decrease I go downhill, I tried and it didn't work. The additional new medicine usually prescribed for another condition has resulted in a few nights of restful sleep and 1 night not so flash. My body is adjusting to the new med, a real low dose, have headaches and feeling nautious but will persevere. Someone like me who hates taking meds now relies on this weird cocktail of prescribed drugs along with theraphy to keep me stable.Meds leave it to the experts that prescribe them. All I know is it's taken a couple of years to get my mix right. I take my prescribed meds and they number quite a few. Hopefully in the long term I will decrease but for me it's still early days.
The weather hasn't been too bad here in Southern Vic. Cloudy but I can get out for a few hours in the garden each day.Best medicine ever. Hope you all had a good weekend and go the Blues, onwards and upwards Yay 
cheers Len Possum,
wow you have such insight.Big hugs! Barry I'm sure you meant well. Research is one thing, suffering from a condition like bipolar is ... You wouldn't wish it on your worst enemy. Without my meds I would be up ship creek.
Cupcakes I could eat an endless supply of sponge cake covered with pink, lemon, chocolate icing and sprinkles ,

Hi there Possum,  :) I'm  sure yoga will work again.its something I've always wanted to do but never did. There are different forms of yoga. I went for a longer bike ride yesterday after 3 hour walk the day before. Resting today. It's cold but at least it's not wet here by the coast,
have a better day folks, be kind to yourselves
cheers LM Terriers are cluey as.
velv I'm sure your girly bits will be as good as new.bit of tweaking by medicos and all good. No offence meant. Agree  with going under is the bees knees. I had enough drugs going under last year to last me a lifetime. Especially with ECT , like 3 times a week at one stage. Won't miss the bowel thingy I had. That was a shitty recovery
wishing you a speedy recovery
cheers LM Hi folks, 
Mimsy welcome aboard the fun ship. Trust me never a dull moment here. Reassuring to see you getting some professional help. Understanding medicos make a difference. I was diagnosed bipolar1 a year and a half ago. I've come a long way since then and lots of support and people who get it here. We can rant as much as we want and we listen.
Bring on the sunshine. My footy team has won 2 in a row. Winners are grinners. Take care folks, be kind yourselves,

  Tony,
wow that's fantastic for both of you.Similiar to you following similar diet has worked. 20 kgs since last June. I'm a lazy cook,eat lots of fruit and grains,I microwave lots and being very regimented nowadays re: food all I know it's working and doesn't it work wonders for the joints, body and mind. I used to love my junk food, but now living and eating very clean. My wife doesn't have to cook for me. Over Winter I'm being kind to myself food wise and monitor my weight with an app or governed by my belt or a quick look in the mirror.I also use an app my son found called Zero based on fasting between dawn and dusk with the goal being 13 between those meals. Like everything once you become used to it and it's a habit. I'd still like to loose a few more kgs but remembering a few years back before everything went ass up I weighed the same but nowadays believe I'm stronger as muscle weighs more then fat. Keep up the great work. It's not an easy thing to do at our age lol. Give yourselves a pat on the back. You inspire those around you. And it's ok to have the occasional treat.Have you and your wife reached your goal weight.?
Have you got your wheels back yet? Always had a laugh watching Lucille Ball and hubby doing road trip with caravan. A great black and white film. Showing my age !
cheers LM Hey Velvet,
you go girl. I'm the sort of cook who googles how to boil an egg, do it and then 3 weeks later if I need to do it again, go back to google.
Tony re: hair in all directions mine has a mind of its own as well. Funny the correlation re: that and mental health. I've a good head of hair I just hate the extra hair you get as you get older, like ear hair ...  I reckon the meds are like a hair tonic or fertilyser.
cheers LM Can't go wrong with a rice cooker. :)
  Hi Possum,
take care, glad you are getting help.We are here for you. I've had to buy a new pill dispenser as I'm on so many pills. Big hug from me to you
LM xox You are more then welcome,
my old one was a carasel thingy and more often then not some of the meds would mix. Frustrated me to bits. So this was not only allows me adequate room, thinking ahead it has push buttons for arthritic fingers and Braille as well as am /pm function. That's me catering for the future. If it came gold plated I would have got that as well. $11 well spent lol.
Tony what a call looking vehicle. Makes my early cars, a xp falcon that I paid $50 and Xm falcon look like a modern vehicle. Must be a hoot driving around in that,
enjoy cheers
LM Hello regulars and welcome Fiasco,
Agree with Quirky, re accepting diagnosis,... I know without my current meds which took a lot of tweeking I'd be up Shi* Creek. My current meds work for me as well. Next week will begin a PTSD group so will need them more then ever. If there were natural remedies for treatment I'd use them, however at present any adjustments for me are usually for the better and any reductions result in a downhill spiral,
take care folks, be kind to yourselves,

it never occurred to me to post from a mobile. I use my iPad mini. Hope you enjoyed the movie with the kids. Thankgod for Netflix. I'm just back from a 4 hour walk. Poor dog got dragged along.

cheers LM xx Hi there Kazz,
Roses are something I struggle with in growing. Though last year with a bit of pampering my roses bloomed and bloomed.That would make a stunning tattoo. I've always excercised, I'm finding 90 minutes most days a must do. By mid arvo regardless I start to feel tense, agitated and once I hit the pillow i struggle. I dread the day I can't do excercise. I overdid it yesterday. Cycled today, cold and windy, tomorrow's a rest day.Im literally starving myself to keep the weight off. Must admit have a bit of an unhealthy attitude to food, but anyway it's working. I can't wait for Winter to end, preparing beds for veggies. Gardening is so therapeutic . I'm out there most days for an hour or two. I get my green thumb and love for gardening from my mother. It was her great escape as well. I often imagine her looking down at me, taking pride in my garden,
 take care, stay warm
cheers LM xox Possum,
hope things improve soon. Long term memory shot. Big gaps. Side effect of ECT, meds and the ravages of time. 
When stressed, memory goes.My memory short term is slowly improving.
Velvet I agree cutting out the bad stuff works a treat. I've peeled off 20 kgs since June last year  and now not eating bread, pasta, red meat and rice has become the norm for me,
cheers LM Hi quirky words,
similar vintage here.in group today lined up youngest to oldest. Looked to my left and no one beside me..@ 54 that's a first lol. I used to laugh collecting antiquarian books when younger or going through the old book shops.
Friends I can count on 1 hand and might see them once every couple of months. My world has become very small but that's my choice. In my case self preservation.
cheers LM Hi Issi,
glad to see TMS is working for you. Headaches are a pain but hopefully just short term and benefits outweigh the losses. I used to have massive headaches after ECT treatment but it helped me turn the corner. Breakfast they say is the most important meal of the day.
ive read that caffeine and bipolar are a bad mix  ,  so this is day 1 with coffee. Sticking to herbal teas and waiting for the headaches to come.im determined to cut coffee out. Early days but will preservere,
have a good one
cheers LM Issi,
hope the headaches pass.im sure they will. Had headaches post ECT but worth it. Turning point for me. Breakfast they say is the most important meal of the day.Slow and gradual works. Baby steps.im trying to give up coffee as it doesn't agree with BP. N headaches yet but I'm sure they will come.
Cold night ahead but nice weekend ahead,
stay warm cheers 
LM Wow Possum,
youve got a lot more energy then this old fart. Takes me back to my early 20s looking at a few caves. Bet you will get some stunning photos. Sounds like you have all the right gear. What fun I'd love to hear all about it down the track. I'm in awe! I used to buy spearfishing mags when younger and gob smacked at the photos from the cave divers. Now they are nuts. Hopefully you will get warmer the deeper you go. Sounds like journey to the centre of the earth.Have fun, stay safe and enjoy yourself. I plan to poke around the garden, doing a vertical garden out of a shoe rack and spend some quality time with my DW and pooch. Roll on Spring, as much as Winter irks me, I've got my good head on for a change,
happy snapping:)
cheers LM Possum,
sounds like fun. Back in the dark ages we lived in caves. It's colder outside. Can't believe of some of the - (minus temperatures) we are experiencing. Canberra -8.9..
wow  I couldn't live there. Went for a couple of bike rides over the weekend. Nice when the sun was out but cold at times.
Stay warm, rug up, maybe a warm hot chocolate, latte or herbal tree and put your feet up. As for me day 4 caffeine free and still no headaches.Maybe 1 positive of all my meds, lots of things nullified lol,
im on the couch, heater on, cashmere scarf on trying to keep warm... 2 more months of Winter brwwwww
cheers LM Doing ok,
cant wait for Winter to pass. It's been really cold this year. I have a good breaky, graze and then eat by 5 and have at least 13 hours between last and first meal.Meds keep me fairly level, sometimes I feel too level and emotionally numb, but what can I do? It's my lot for the firseeable future. Could be a lot worse. Stay safe and warm folks, hope you are doing ok,
cheers LM Hi Possum,
enjoy ! That's a lovelly suprise for you all. Sounds idyllic and there's nothing like a magical,mystery tour. My wife and I are going to try hot spring baths next month. Very therapeutic apparently. Do us both the world of good. Can't wait to hear of your experience and hope you all enjoyed it,
cheers LM Sapphira,
i break out in song at the weirdest times. I used to be quite emotional, angry at the oddest things. My current meds and treatments keep me fairly level. Unfortunatelly due the meds I'm incapable of showing much emotion at all. I really have no alternative at the moment.At times I hate this as well  but through it all I'm in a much better place. 
Cheers LM Hi Possum,
relate perfectly, haven't had the high highs but was in the low lows for months when really unwell.Now mostly even keel but even today much the same as you3/10- 7/10. Theres a bit going on and manifesting itself in tension headaches increasingly over the last week. I'm just started another course at Private Psych Hospital and there's a bit happening. I don't know where I'd be without my meds. It's a matter of finding the right formula. I leave it to the medical experts. An understanding GP and psych go a long way. In a moment of crisis I can have music or a song going through my head. The mind is a strange thing.
Back in 1991 I was diagnosed with depression and medicated.1997- ADHD and medicated and late 2015 BP 1.  Possum I know it takes time to adjust to new meds. A while back was prescribed a new med a blood preassure tablet of all things to cut back n vivid nightmares.i felt sick for a week but it worked. Nightmares have greatly diminished.
cheers LM
  Hi Possum,
Sounds like you are going through a bad patch.Bipolar and mental illness is a bummer but it can be beaten or managed with the right treatment, medication, psychs and the passages of time. You are early in your diagnosis and treatment and meds. It's takes time to get it right. There are so many variables. With a broken arm or leg it's an easy fix. The human brain is no easy fix, so msny chemicals,life experiences and every human being is different and special. Psychiatrists are amaysing considering what fronts and presents on a daily basis.To your credit you're not giving in. I came close but turned the corner and despite some massive dips it's still a daily battle, nowhere near as hard as it was. I'm now in the final module of DBT and started a PSTD course. My life has changed dramatically but for the better. Would I change anything. Some things I would if I could but great believer in everything happens for a reason. It's made me a better person. My family have commented I'm in a much better place.There has been some shit times, will continue to be but there will be good times as well.
Everyones journey is different. That's what makes us humans such complex beings, no easy fix but it's just a matter of chipping away.
im reaching out to give you a hug if that's ok
cheers LM Hi QuirkyWords,
i often forget what day it is. It's freezing.  Thunderstorms and hail on the way. Hopefully be my induced state by then. Trying to cut back on my meds yet again, so far so good. . It's been a busy week. Posting here and chilling out and listening to some golden oldies on Spotify. Stay warm folks. Guess people are lying low,
cheers LM take care Velvet,
this weather doesn't help at all.Hugs if I may:)
Quirky, tomorrow is going to be colder. Brrrrrr. Have my Ugg slippers on. A throw rug and the dog. Luckily I have a course on tomorow . More theraphy I need all the help I can get. Been watching River Cottage Australia. I could live out in the sticks quite easily. Away from a lot of business,
cheers stay warm peoples Issi,
well done for getting out of your comfort zones. Can relate to getting headaches when changes occurs.
Velvs they say laughter is the best medicine.Take care and be kind to yourself. You always have a great spin on things.
Tony, you are heading in the right direction. It's pretty cold in Vic. the wind drives me batty.ive managed to reduce some of my meds over a 3 week period with no ill effects.
Last time I tried i fell in a heap. 
Stay warm folks, have a good one,
cheers Len Hi Issi,
reckon the cold weather is driving everyone undercover.Trying to stay warm. Am eating a bit more because of the cold.Hope everyone's keeping well and warm. Roll on Spring. Im over Winter. Way to cold for this old fart. The weathers not conjusive to do much at all. Looking forward to hitting the sack. Big day @ Trauma program.Stuffed
cheers LM Hello folks,
I have mini bipolar moments now. I gradually ceased my PRN meds over the last month and was feeling up. Increased appetite, more awareness and out to f my shell a bit more. The last week despite excercise, struggled to get to sleep at night. The past 3 nights I recommended my Prns with a immediate affect of falling asleep easily, downside withdrew into my shell a bit more, can described it as disconnected but now realysing once against that I can't stuff around with my meds. Doing a PSTD group which was  raising a lot of crap from my previous employment. Spring is just around the corner. Days are longer, flowers and birds are bursting at the seams. Looking forward to the season ahead. Baby steps again and one day at a time,
cheers LM Hi Lady,
hope you are having a good one. Where is everybody?Lying low because of the wind. One of my pet hates. Feeling a bit funny, anxious maybe cos DBt has only a couple of weeks and trauma group stirring things up.Time to draw on  toolbox of things learnt to get through,mindfullness, distress tolerance, radical acceptance, turning the mind and a whole lot of other stuff. Realise I've made progress and it's a fine line between pleasure and pain.Not excercising at present due to medical issue and eating a lot more then I have.
a dip which I'm not overly flash about. A bit of uncertainty in the weeks ahead. I need to ride it out.its a never ending saga, but they are the cards I've been dealt with, stay warm folks, come out of the woodwork when ready,
cheers Len Hi Velvet,
attack of the munchies here too. Sultanas, pepitas, prunes and some bran..Keeping busy is good. Great to hear you are kicking some goals. I do Mindfullness, progressive muscle relaxation and boxed breathing. It all works don't know whether it's anxiousness I best describe it as uneasy and unsure.. It's just a stage... I'm sure once the warmer weather arrives and I regain my focus I will be ok. I've been a hell of a lot worse lol
cheers enjoy the munchies ($20 for 4 packs of timtams@ the airport what a rip off)
Len Hi Tony,
great to hear you have fully recovered. No place like home but it's bloody freezing at the moment.  My moods are fluctuating at the moment. Almost felt like I needed to go back into hospital but dealt with it.Lots of stuff stirred up though Trauma group and DBT. You are right on the money with chemical inbalance. Something I'm acutely aware of. It's a bummer.By the sounds of it lucky we have supportive other halves.
Issi, I hope it works for you. Can relate having had ECT and the headaches and tiredness that goes along with it. Velvet mmmmm, muesli bars love the choc flavoured ones.
Quirky will fan the wind back towards you. I gather it's going to get worse. I hate it so.i should accept its late winter, it's windy at this time,I love your profile pic btw.
Didnt buy the timtams.. Much much cheaper at the supermarket. I guess for the unsuspecting tourist or a must have as an option..... Noooo...
stay warm cheers Len Hi Issi,
its ok to be selfish. It's looking after yourself. TMS like ECT knocks you around a bit. You need time to recover. I know this is coming from a male perspective. Hats off to you for trying to do it all. Be kind to yourself.Small baby steps.Love your positivity,
cheers Len Another vote for not being on a even keel.Well at least you folks are afloat. I've been like the Titanic, sunken, broken after hitting an iceberg. Doing ok now. Afloat with the help of my life vest.. A life worth living :) 
cheers Airies My meds keep me on an even keel, so much so that I'm emotionally numb. Any adjustment when i play around with dosage stuffs me up bigtime. Lots of theraphy, time, skills learnt, so far so good. I have relapses but nothing like in the past. I know I will never be better but my new self is so much better then the old. I'm off tap sometimes as in slightly high but not the manic highs of before or the gut wrenching lows. I take it one day at a time in my small small world but that's ok. I reach out here and hopefully help others as they have helped me,
cheers Airies Hi meercat,
ive been on my meds for about a year and a half so relatively stable. Past month increased eating, tension and not feeling quite right somes it up. Feels tense, gritted teeth and headaches like I had when ECT.. It's a rollercoaster, it never goes away. I have a loving wife, 2 boys and my little dog.  I've battled with my weight all my life, now in my skinny  phase but gained a kg or 2.My current psych hasn't diagnosed BP )1) but was diagnosed in the past. and now taking part in a mangosteen trial for BP. My little mini foxy is just like a meercat , stands on 2 legs and the most inquisitive beast out there.
Quirky I'm the domestic God at our house. Love my Dyson, though my wife reckons it's cumbersome and doesn't do the job.i like my avatar as well. I'm a mad gardener and plus it was on the front cover of my PTSD folder and it captured me.
I guess I'm in limbo at the moment. I do things to keep busy, doing ok, but not at times.Thats life. Just got to ride out the crummy moments... Lovelly to get some sunshine today. A bit of vitamin D makes such a difference,
Nad I've dropped people/ family who don't get me. Its survival and a duty of care to yourself. Can relate to the Ect memory loss and headaches. My memory is still screwed but i don't regret the treatment and at the time things were pretty dire. Running around after a 4 month old. I take my hat off to you. I've a 21 and 23 year old so I don't do much running around . BB and this thread are great as people here get it , I didn't realise TMS was so pricy. I was going to go down that part if Ect didn't work,
cheers Airies Hi meercat,
when I was on medication it was like a lightbulb moment for me. Obtained so much clarity. Only on it for a few months due to being so unwell, not hydrating properly I ended up in hospital as my kidneys almost packed up. On other meds now. Only close family and folk here lol know I'm bipolar. I've had a few good days this week...love the Suns Ray's but floundered last week. Thankfully I got through it. I'm eating like there's no tomorow and then floggng myself with excecise which is no good. Need to draw on skills learnt through DBT to cope,
Another warm one tomorow , roll on Summer,
cheers Airies
 Saying hello to everyone,
daylght saving is great, doing more but eating more.. Food one of my triggers.14 hours sleep last night. Rowed 2 hours on machine walked dog for an hour to stop eating more.using zero app to track weight and eating. Back to basics to what works. A 100g weight gain feels like a kilo. All or nothing person. I can't to moderate.Feel ok today... Got to take it 1 day at a time.
Quirky what keeps you working 7 X days?
cheers all. Wish the weather would warm up again bbbrrrrr it's getting cold and I'm getting old Quirky,
in another life I worked in a number of libraries and was an avid reader. Sounds idyllic your job obviously a labour of love. Did my 2 hour fix again then ravenous eating.:( oh well some sort of  balance. I loved to read autobiographies. I don't read now ..only here lol,
cheers Airies Hi Meercat,
li didn't agree with me. Ended up in hospital kidneys not happy. Re cruising have you done the South Pacific? Cruised it 3 times and had a ball. Next cruise Vietnam and surrounds for my wife's birthday. Couldn't cruise NZ a tad rough for my wife. Great fan of the indoor cabins. Can lock myself away and sleep 24 if need be,
cheers  Hi Lady,
well done on loosing some weight and having that discipline. I'm finally realysing that I need 2 hours of excercise daily to keep me sane. Food, binge eating and excecise extremes are me to a tee. Just polished off a box of clix. Stressed with a medical thingy tomorow.
Good on you for doing the volunteer work. Be kind to yourself. Must be a BP thing. I'm rarelly happy with my reflection in the mirror. Why are we so hard on ourselves, hope things pick up ,
cheers Airies Hi Quirky,
40 minutes a day is better then nothing, be it a walk, stretching , Pilates , yoga, cycling or gardening. I tend to do things pretty full on.But I mix it up. Some days I just don't like what I see in the mirror. The ravages of time have taken their toll. Other days I'm ok. I take it one day at a time,
Airies Velvet I love your spin on things ,
great sense of humour. One thing about being on the wrong side of fifty your eyesight goes( along with other things). I've had spectacles all my life.without them on looking in the mirror sometimes not flash, with them on ... Geez lots of lines and flaws lol. Vain who me yeah a little bit.
re excercise , I've over excercised my whole life... running long distances, marathons and stuff. Along with overeating and the rest. Life around me is never dull.I am tiring though. My wife deserves a medal.i am fortunate to have my wife and family
 cheers No wonder there was that hit song,
tell me why I don't like Mondays back in the 80s.For me it could be any day. I'm not a morning person and by late arvo the cracks appear. Will find Xmas taxing. I used to be the life of the party once but party no more.
if it's a sunny day it opens up a world of opportunities.Have had enough of  Melbournes topsy, Turvy weather. Roll on Summer,
cheers Airies I've always had private health insurance.WI'll drop it eventually .Big bowl of salad for dinner, veggies for me.But by avoiding certain food groups i know long term probably not the best f choices. Especially wth Xmas coming up I think we can allow ourselves a few luxuries. My days of making new year resolutions are long gone. I take it one day at a time. I was so tired after lunch I needed to have a few hours in bed. So tired but listen to my body. Rest when I need it 
cheers Airies Hi folks,
congrats on the birth of your nephew.Chocolate, food I can't stop eating at the moment. Gained 10 kgs since June:(. I starved myself to get down to my goal weight.Anyway part of my cycle. I felt really really off over Xmas.Hospital was my next step but i got through it. Still not right but it's been building for months. Glad Xmas and New Year is over.
Velvetfaerie , your chicken experience reminds me of when I spent 5 minutes choking of a fish bone. Tried bread, water for 5 minutes it was pure hell. Your ecperiences was obviously a lot longer.
its one day at a time for me. Take care and be kind to yourselves
cheers  Doing a lot of comfort eating at the moment. Eat whether high or low. Yo yo dieting doesn't help. I'd love to get back into consistent excercise but more importantly consistent healthy eating. So sad to hear of the passing of the lead singer of the Cranberries, a sufferer of bipolar. Love chocolate, vanilla slices, a good sponge cake... I love food.. That's my problem, currently not so flash,
cheers  Velvet,
you inspired me. 2 hours of indoor rowing, cycling and weights. Only way to get my mojo back. I used an app where you try and keep 12 hours between your last meal and breaky. I've started using it again. Day 2 of being good. i used to have nightmares trips even until my psych prescribed of all things a high blood preassure med and it worked.
Music love all sorts - Beatles to Lorde.Youtube or Spotify rock when I work out.Love all sorts of docos. Netflix so addictive, one show rocks into another.
Hot day tomorrow. Pity the tennis players at the Australian Open,
cheers One day at a time for me. The apps called zero ( assuming you have an iPhone. Stopped using it in June until the other day. It helped me. A light row for me today. Have to fire up the air conditioner. Gotta listen to ones body:). A barbell and weights ( eBay) for this dumbbell. More stuff to inspire,
cheers  Quirky,
belated birthday greetings. Happy Birthday for yesterday. Good on you for reaching a milestone. Guess we are similar vintage but it would be rude of me to ask lol.
i gave away my beloved vinyl copy collection to my ex brother in law years ago. Speweing now as when I was young I religiously brought an album each fortnight. My first purchase I remember Breakfast in America by SuperTramp.Had all the Beatles, Lennons stuff. Anyway all gone now and Youtube and Spotify ok but geez vinyl sounded so good.I do have a nice surround sound system with a wicked sub woofer Love to turn it up.
Listening to radio talk stations sounds like a good idea. A nice distraction from the banter in my head. Stayed up later last night. If I've not in bed by 10 or earlier I am rooted.
Emergency chocolate money sounds like a brilliant idea. Could use in daily 
cheers Lady,
i hope things pickup. I know if I stay up late, things spiral.i was feeling off a while back, at a loss to explain why and just like you wanted to be ok. Things picked up, I don't know why they just did.i take it one day at a time,sometimes hour by hour and sometimes it's just blah blah.Love your taste in music.I couldn't be bothered going back to vinyl.Youtube, Spotify and music CDs or DVDs are an easy option. Off to psych tomorow to deal with PTSD stuff. A tad nervous,
cheers Velvetfaerie,
hats off to you for managing medication free. Takes true grit and resilience. I rely on my meds. Excercise and diet help. I just pigged out on Kfc , lollies and chocolate and spent some quality time with my son playing an old fashioned board game. Spent 3 hours excercise today which was good. Frustrating at KFC, young kid with what must have been brand new braces and elastics. Drawn out saga to order. I couldn't understand him at all talking through gritted teeth. It was funny and frustrating but why have him on the front counter. The chips were soggy as well but my son and I had a ball. Dragged him away from the computer and so nice to relate to one another. Anybody been watching I'm a celebrity get me out of here? My wife and I make a point of holding hands when walking the dog.
going to be a wicked night of dreams with all the crap I've eaten, meds and excercyding
cheers Loula,
dream holidays, I love cruising ( on the high seas), great way to get pampered, see the sights and realise how vast the sea is. No potato and gravy can't stomache it.
id love to do a cruise through Alaska, all that Nordic stuff and I always wanted to climb Everest or get to base camp. I now have a fear of heights. My meds totally stuff me up in that regard. I watched a series on NetFlix where a handful of people were living in isolated parts of Alaska and lived off the land hunting and fishing. Totally blew me away.
i can't cook to save myself. Luckily my other half is a brilliant cook. Go for it as going on the show. Been watching a bit of Married at First sight. That's totally daft.
Neon snakes sounds totally wicked. Gawd knows what I will be dreaming about tonight.
Tomorow more xcecise to burn off the calories. Sweet dreams I hope 
cheers Velvet,
must be a bipolar thing as in latent feelings throughout the day. My dreams are very vivid and often work related(PTSD ) and lingers on more often then not throughout the day. 
Airfryer sounds very user friendly. My wife has every apparatus known to man. A great cook. If we had the room I'd buy one.
Quirky I must admit our 3 cruises have always been in a warm climate. They are great fun and the food is simply Devine .
i too would like t be medication free but that won't happen.Hope all have an OK weekend.
cheers Have same problems re dreams.They play on your mind. Some nights are ok but most it's vivid as. My wife says it's just a dream. Means well but really no one knows the anguish as we do. It's just a s**t and I wish it would go away.
No excecise for me today. Bulk of day in garden and pooped. Counts as excercise. This mild wether is very excercise friendly. A must do tomorow after the domestic chores,
cheers Lycra stretches Thankfully. Talking about my situation not yours lol. Excercise gives me energy a buzz once done for a few hours and then rested.
Been so so busy in the garden so excercise has suffered.Still overeating since Xmas. Need to get disciplined. Some hot days ahead.
Airies has Lycra lots of it but it doesn't fit:( Issi,
youre husband sounds better organised then me.Luckily I'm very fortunate my wife is very organised. We have travelled and a few years ago discovered  cruising where you unpack once and pack when you leave and it's so so easy. I spent a few days asleep in our indoor cabin when pooped or it was a little too much. I always feel flat after a holiday but relieved to get home. It's a few years before our next holiday which seems an eternity away, not that I'm hanging out for a holiday who knows how I will be.Happy Valentines hugs all round
cheers
  Velvet,
you work your butt off.recreation leave is your entitlement.Maybe look at your award, unions aren't strong anymore. Maybe just book it and say you are going. I feel for you.on top of everything else you're getting a rough deal through no fault of your own.Maybe fair work Australia. Jobs are hard to come by but slave labour went out years ago.Hopefully meeting happens sooner rather then later Velvet,
sounds like the other manager was a bully.Good on you do standing up to them.Look after number 1 which is you. You certainly haven't come down in the last shower and aren't a fool. I know back in the public service you could have an independent person sitting in.You need a break. It's not worth burning out. Sick Leave, Recreation Leave and RDOs are a given. 
Cheers Lady,
well done on the job interview. Job trial Yu will nail it. I'm a bit off. Not xcecysing and it's been a gradual decline over 6 months. Will self admit in a few weeks to adjust meds as the real worlds doing my head in. Time for a reboot. I'm doing ok. Quiet well but a bit off
cheers Hello All,
doing well. Last night didn't have my meds prepared and went cold turkey and had none until early morning and had some PRN. This morning felt fantastic. Going into hospital in a few weeks to sort out meds and see psych to discuss. I've been playing around with my meds which isn't the best thing. Will get myself sorted with some medical intervention.
cheers Hi folks,
been a while. See a few new names here. Great to see. I've told a few friends since my diagnosis BP 1 in 2015. Some get it. Others dropped me like a hot scone.wentnin hospital a while back for a tune up.. All good. Been doing PTSD sessions but taking a break. I am almost therapied out.Love affair with food ongoing and excercise a thing of the past. One day soon a little switch in my head goes off , diet, excercise and everything else full on. Never a dull moment and thankgod for me meds. Without it will be up in s**t creek. Beautiful day outside, lorikeets calling. Isn't Autumn a nice time of year?
cheers Airies Hello everyone,
Issi I used to be a crier, but one of the downsides of my meds is that now I'm emotionally numb. Whether it's a coping mechanism or something I don't know.
Tams glad to see you here. love your positivity. Having a lifestyle change in my neck of the woods. Moving house, downsizing after 3 decades in the one house. Been busy with the logistics f selling, buying and now packing. It's like a breath of fresh air. Another nice day outside. 
cheers  Hi folks,
been a while for me too. I'd be up the creek without my meds. (10 tablets, various concoctions). Not excercising, eating wrong, making wrong choices. Moving house and that's stressful in its own way. 30+ years in the 1 house and never moved. It's amaysing how 
much crap you accumulate. It's gonna be worth it in the end. As for people, only a select few are allowed. Yet I used to be such a cregarious person. Not so now.
cheers  Velvet,
you hit the nail on the head. I want to do everything and nothing after work today. Daily I struggle with a all or nothing attitude. It's been the same my whole life. I can't do moderate. It's a never ending battle. I need to get back to some theraphy and the basics. Mindfullness and all the other stuff I've learnt but of late not practising. A work in progress is me 
cheers No need to feel silly. We're ok it's the other 90% of normal people who are the problem.Not a fan of Winter, but having said that went for a walk, sun was out and the birds were chirping. For once I didn't get caught in the rain. Starting to excercise again. I need it, badly to relax, sleep ok and not feel uptight. It's one day at a time, one moment at a time. I struggle at the day's end. I either singing like really loud, ( stuff the neighbours) and they know I'm loopy or completely pooped. Sunshine please hang around
cheers Hi folks,
another lovelly winters day. It won't last but I'll grab the Suns Ray's whenever I can. I've got it in my head that I need to excercise every day. Today only a walk but I did it. Tams if I have a few drinks I'm a blubbering idiot. Must be the meds. Moving house soon, it's been stressful and I'm not the most tolerant person after a few hours of lugging stuff around. It will be worth it. I need to go to the dentist. Something  I've been putting off for a few years.i had braces and had nice teeth, but find myself grinding my teeth daily and end result broken flings and the like. Last thing i need is a lecture from the dentist. I've been googling life expectancy of bipolar person. Not that I expect to drop off the perch tomorow but I often think these meds are taking their ttoll and I almost have a rather flippant attitude to life and   death. Having said that I intend being around for a few years yet. I'm not depressed at all. I see my psych tomorow or I think I am. Usually get a reminder on my phone but maybe got dates stuffed up. Anyway more xcecise tomorow ,
cheers  Doing ok,
excercysing everyday. It's a given for me now, no choice. Without it I'm screwed. It's the only 
thing that keeps me on a even keel(with my meds), sleep. One day at a time
cheers Hi Quirky,
hopefully things will turn around wit the long weekend and more people buying things as opposed to just browsing. How's the weather doing in your part f the world. I can't get over the mild start to Winter, it's nice when's the suns out. We won't get a decent hit of rain until late in the week
hope others are doing ok, take care
cheers Hi folks,
I find relationships hard. I'm in my own little world for a lot of the time. It's been 3 years since my breakdown and I've withdrawn from friends, family. It's a matter f survival and I guess I've been a loner. Yet I used to be the life of the party. A scream when I was pissed. These days  I don't socialise at all. My psych wants me to extend myself and socialise more. I don't think that will happen. Too taxing. I'm hard work :(
cheers Mmmmm chocolate . Polished off a block last night along with a pack of biscuits. Day 11 of continuos excercise as in not missing a day. It's a promise I've made to myself. It's that all or nothing thing...... No moderate at all.  Velvet I put myself first always nowadays. Purely selfish but it works for me. Hope you had a good gym workout. 
Cheers 
  I used to have brilliant ideas, 99% of them in my head and not practical. I've cut back on one f my meds. I'm so alert and with it as a result. I've been up all Winter. Excercising every day. That's the all or nothing part of me. I was diagnosed Bipolar by a psych back a few years back when I was at my lowest ebb. My current psych diagnosed severe or accute depression with a few other things. I know it's just a label but should I ask my latest Psych whether or not she agrees. I know at the time my diagnosis and treatment with medication was like a light bulb moment. I'm feeling very OK and don't really know why. I hope it lasts as the other end of the spectrum was a scary and hellish place to be. If you had asked me a number of years ago I'd be ok I would have told you no way known. I've become socially isolated according to my psych. I keep in touch with 1 close friend and lucky to see him twice a year,

 July 1st and into our new house. A fresh start. Speaking of making people giggle and a sign of my advancing years. I poured a fresh glass of milk, walked away and came back a few minutes later. Picked up a glass and thought this milk looks curdled and not quite right. Plus it had a label on the sign. Upon bringing it to my lips and cursing a bit realised I was trying to drink a bloody candle, my wife and I nearly wet ourselves laughing .. cheers
  Re weight gain, mine fluctuates all the time. With the meds it's one of the side effects and I'm on quite a ccktail of  meds.its left me emotionally numb. I can't cry at all. I used to see saw all the time even with the meds. Passages of time, countless courses, hospital admission when need be have made a huge difference. Personally I think this s as good as I'm going to get. My psych says I'm socially withdrawn or isolated but what's the matter with that? I'd rather chat here ...
cheers V,
good on you for standing up for yourself.You don't need the aggravation and what a great response. I hope you get your leave. Your bloody entitled to it. A wedding, haven't been to one for a couple of years and before that it was ages ago. Life is full of cycles..Births Deaths, engagements, weddings and or course the ebbs and flows, surnamis of being bipolar. 
Settling into new house. Going to be quite lonely as youngest son, leaves the nest and works interstate.My kids have grown up overnight. I wish I'd been a better dad. Always consumed with work in the past.Anyway I'm still here which is better then not
cheers Airies Hey V,
you are a breath of fresh air. I try and look forward but it's tough, really tough. I've been a tough task master on my kids.I should count my self fortunate to have wife, kids, roof over my head etc.
go sick, do what you have to do. You have a duty f care to yourself.Your man thing and yourself deserve to lash out every now and then. We all do. Saw Mamma Mia the musical and had a ball.Nice to see my wife happy. The last few years have been hard on her.
i need to take control of eating, excercise, struggle with that balance thing. Tomorow is another day... Hugs to all
cheers Airies
  Hi folks,
guess it's hard to practice what we preach. if I look to closely at myself all I see is my pitfalls, weaknesses. Keep on drawing a line in the sand in regards to improving myself and keep on redrawing the line. aaaaaarrrrg.
cheers Airies Coping,
yes and no. Eating chocolate, donuts and so so tired. Don't know what excecise is at the moment. Tomorow is another day . I should get off my ass and do something. I'm the domestic God in our house. Given my wife works, cooks a and runs herself ragged. She doesn't ask much of me. My wife would be happier if my weight, fitness improved. Not a huge ask but no can do at the moment.
cheers Airies V,
im like you. I'm ok but tired.just want to stay in bed.Need to get some fresh air. Seems like every couple of years , I'm fit, weight fluctuates, feel great and then. Constant reboots, upgrades. I'd love to spend my remaining years fit, healthy with realistic goals. Mmmmmmm liquorice yummm partial to chocolate coated bullets.... Quite an apt name I think.
walk my pooch and some other excecise. Day 1 lol
cheers Airies Hi folks,
i can remember the most obscure things, my first few car number plates, weird shit. The passages or ravages of time, medications, ect treatment have taken their toll. It's one day at a time. I was diagnosed 3 years ago, it explains a lot that has occurred during my life and since dis gnosis.
Nowadays, I don't socialise much,running on adreline a thing of the past. I once thrived n life, excercise , work, impulsivity , the whole gamett , but no more.
Thinking Quirky and I are the old heads here... as in age, not BP experiences or life experiences. I love the zest, input, understanding that you and all others bring.
Collectively we get one another. Welcome Candyman. The more the merrier,
cheers  Hi Folks,
old blue eyes here. Quirky I'm hitting 55. My kids are in their early 20s and doing well.Tams I don't know about being grounded. Just a tad more settled these days after a scary few years, but I'm all over the shop.Its an  all or nothing mentality with me. That little switch in my head goes on and off.
Fathers day- will hear from my boys. Just happy if they're happy. That's all I want. First day off Spring. Time to get active again.
Have a good one 
cheers  Hi folks,
my psych assured me that no genetic link in regards to bipolar, depression being genetically passed onto kids. Don't know about that one as my mother suffered depression, grandmother committed suicide and I suffer from bipolar. Time will tell.
Quirky lol at me being young. I am stuffed. 60 is my 5 years away . Gawd a lot can happen in that time. Road trips... No can do... Usually wife and I argue when we get lost, traffic becomes too busy and in unfamiliar territory. I hate driving in Melbourne. My driving is not too flash these days... Old age and meds.
i am pooped . Big day in the garden . Pleasantly tired
cheers Loula,
enjoy your road trip. The Great Ocean Road is beautiful. We have some overseas friends coming next year and we plan to highlight it to them. I know it very well.
V hope you getting higher duties. In my career you used to have to do the task for a week before you were rewarded. Typical public service abuse. I'm off for a holiday in the sun for a week. Brought some fat clothes to fit. Lifestyle stage when I return.
Quirky ask away ... We have all the answers .
Have a good one and hope your footy team wins
cheers Fun holidays,
cruising is the bees knees. Totally endulged, you unpack once and that's it. Everyday you are in a different port. The food is unreal. I'm a great fan.  im not too  excited about the holiday. I should be grateful but everything at the moment is an effort. I plan to read a book, veg out in the sun and hopefully get my act together upon my return. Flying very early so will be asleep in medicated bliss I wish. cheers and take care Hi All,
back from island of the gods. I survived. I was so so violently ill in the early hours on our first day. Combination of alcohol, prescribed meds and being knocked around. I was ready to come home. For the remainder of hols stuck to chicken broths, soda water and Indonesia n food. Realysing I have to very careful re types of food, nil alcohol intake for future hols. Lost weight lol and rewarded myself with a nice tattoo on my last day. Good to be home
cheers Airies V,
tattoo of the fab4. Next will be a psychedelic sleeve based on the same theme. Logging all my food intake via an app to help to peel off the kgs. GP sas it's not all my fault as some of the meds don't help. Determined to loose the weight yet again. One day at a time. I wish the weather would warm up.. Roll on summer,
cheers  Hello folks,
love daylight saving and the warmer weather.just back from a ride on my pushy ( that's a bike not a typo). I've a sore backside. My new Lycra Knicks didn't help. Loosing weight slowly. Been getting my vegie patch ready. Nothing like home grown vegies. I could quite happily live off the grid but I'm pretty useless handyman wise and wouldn't last long. Watching all those docs on Netflix where people live out in the sticks. I couldn't live without a few creature comforts.. Hope everyone's week improves
cheers quirky,
i can get t off quickly .  It's keeping it off that's the hard part. Drizzling here so indoor excercise today. Good for the garden. Hope you and others having a good one,
cheers Hi Folks,
i try and garden using a lunar app. Tells me which days to water, sow, mow, the whole thing, collect my own seed from my plants( tomatoes, zucchini,. Must be a bipolar thing as its either full on or not. Worm farming as well.
Tams I ride by myself, safer that way, so sore after an nfrequent ride yesterday. My dog s tired after we walked 14 ks the other day. Having a rest day today. Nice and warm with a change coming. Conjusive to staying indoors. 
Coping wth setbacks.. I guess we never give up, though for a long time I did and lucky to be here. Life's as good as its going to be. Thankgod for psychs, meds, counselling and folks here on BB who get one another.
cheers  Hello Quirky,
lots of apps, it's a matter of finding the good ones. Tried the mushroom thingy in the past to no avail. Must be a magic to it. Our new house has a herb garden when we arrived so lucky in that regard.
Need to go for a walk while the weather holds. Can't wait for more warmer weather,
cheers Don't know whether it's low levels of concentration I'm consumed by the moment, hyper focus and then am scattered. Struggle to retain things. I'm so so tired. 15 hours sleep required Latelly.im really watching what I eat but that's not the cause. I found  my old school reports. Years of teachers saying , struggles to concentrate, with more application he could.... and so on. Done ok academically, just a late bloomer.
cheers I get cranky with people and need my space. A lot of my time in my own little world. I always had a thought growing up that I wouldn't marry, have kids or live past a certain age. Married had kids and lived past thirty. Always thought I'd end up alone on a park bench with nothing. So much for positive thinking lol. Lost another kg ...Excercise and my fitness pal Ap finally paying dividends. Have an end goal in weight. Will do it again and hopefully no yo yo dieting. It's warm and windy, change on the way, not a good day to be outside in this neck of the woods,
cheers Roll on Summer,
i can remember as a kid wishing I was one year older....in a hurry to grow up. Now I'd love to be one year younger. I'd be in the sensitive and cranky club big time. Always been over sensitive. Now with meds comfortably numb not. A day in bed today. Didn't get out of bed till late arvo. Extra meds last night to sleep with the roll on effect.  Looking forward to sleep again,
cheers Velvet,
glad to see you on the mend wth some medical intervention. Sounds like you been through the mill. No doubt looking forward to home and own bed. I have a comfy bed but by the time I hit the sack , my meds,amount of excercise and what sort of day I have dictate how I sleep. 
Speedy recovery
cheers Hi and welcome,
rest assured you will always get a response from this nutty crew. I have type 1, retired early due to PTSD and my bipolar. I won't work again.  
cheers Hi folks,
fixated on stuff all the time. Now it's excercise and logging food. Trying to loose weight. See sawing and yo yo dieting all my life. It's all or nothing for me. I can excercise 2-3 hours a day, but by the end of it I'm n the couch, tense, gritting teeth and then once in bed much the same. I notice the most bizarre things, find beauty in the weirdest things. Must be a bipolar thing. We are wired differently to the rest of the folk. I need to buy things, excercise lots,... Did someone mention licorice. Chocolate coated bullets, has to be milk chocolate, Darrell lee or the equivalent. All for me dnot share. I'm like a wolf when it comes to munchies. It's all for me. I'd go to the supermarket 3-4 times a week and buy, bullets, snowballs, milk chocolate and devour the lot within a hour of being home. Then the guilt, need for xcecise and how crappy that stuff is for you. It's tiring beng bipolar. One day I will just keel over. I don't see myself living to a ripe old age but I've packed a hell of a lot in. One day at a time.
cheers Hi folks,
Tams you articulate it so well.can relate on all levels. Gawd life would be dull and mundane without us. I'm indifferent to a lot of things these days and yet can get worked up over the littlest things. My meds help but at a cost. Will be glad when Xmas is over. Small number of people's coming over but that will be enough. Taxing enough as it is. It will do my head in.
A high achiever relatively late in my career but along the way very very good at ticking the boxes, getting everything done way ahead of time, high functioning, hyper alert until it all came to a head and burnt out.  I accept my lot, my diagnosis, treatment lots of courses have helped and the rollercoaster continues. I'm in a ok place. Imagine a table of a dozen of us around a Xmas table. We would have a hoot of a time . Love my veggie garden, keeps me busy. I try and eat healthy... Try most of the time. I'm an impulsive buyer.. I need things , but no sooner bought need something else. My wife handles the finances. Polar opposites, somehow it works and 30 years later, I love her to bits. I am hard work. My life has become routine, out of necessity..  It's always one day at a time for me. It has to be . Xmas gotta get through it.. Nature is putting a lovely display lots of rain, thunder and lightening and the temperature has dropped bigtime. 
Cheers Hi All,
catching up here. Robin Williams would be a cooky dinner partner. Velvet I love reading your 
posts ... Especially when you're in full flight and on a roll. If that makes sense.. The uppercase stuff, exclamations ect.. I feel so so sick. A bad taste of the munchies, chips, chocolate bullets, ice covered donuts all consumed in rapid succession. Do I feel better noo. I will pay for it. Could be a lot worse lol. Could be doing it daily. Yesterday on my bicycle 40 degrees temp off the road surface.   I was fried and today it's freezing. Victorian weather.gotta love it. At last my vegies will be happy with the rain and stuff,
have a good one cheers Merry Christmas folks,
it's another day to get through. It's at our house , number of people turning up has changed and though my wife is doing the bulk of everything I will be very happy once it's passed. I'm not normally a Scrooge but I don't need the stresses. Extra meds a bit bombed out. As John Lennon once said, "Whatever gets you through the night, it's Alright, it's Alright". Will hopefully spark up once guests arrived. Have a good one, cheers I guess we BP people really get one another, understand the high, the lows, the condtant fluctuations whereas our partners, spouses as best they try don't get it. I've had a couple of really shitty days, binge eating, crappy thoughts and in the back of my mind I've had a perceived need to spend a week or 2 in hospital to escape the real world, then today I rallied excercised and apart from polishing off the block of chocolate remaining from my binge purchase it's another day. Constant headaches,clenching teeth and it's the same day in day out. I've become so so regimented apart from when I loose the plot.. Here I am mid fifties and excercising 2 hours plus every day cos I have to and its that all or nothing mentality. I look in the mirror and what do I see. A person at complete loggerheads with oneself, whether it's visual perceived .. Gawd I'm ranting a bit aren't I? I see my psych next week thank god. I do day by day, I don't make long term plans cos I just don't. Im ok but it's a Shiite existence sometimes ,
  My wife deserves the biggest medal ever for living with me. I've always excercised. An outlet for me but now I do it as I have too. I used to enjoy it so much but now it's become a medication. 2 hours a day and I might feel ok. I've arranged to go back into the psych hospital to go back to ground zero. As a private patient so as not so confronting as the public system but I'm fighting it . Worried about how my wife will cope, working, the garden, the dog. The little things I do. I've just done a big row and walk and then undone it all by pigging out. Food is always a go too. When young I could get away with it. Now the ravages f time and the advancing years not to mention the increased appetite with my meds my yo yoing with everything continues. Tomorow is another day.So so looking forward to seeing my psych so she can make sense of my madness. 
  Tis another day,
pulled the plug on hospital. Saw my psych suggested I need to socialyse more, do a TAFE course, men's shed . We are meant to be social beings. So that being said, I've brought an electronic drum kit. So so excited to learn and just immerse myself.My wife doesn't know what I'm going to do next.That was yesterday, today I woke up and thought shit what am I doing ? Is this another thing that will sit in corner?  Feelings of guilt, elation, deflation all at once. Hospital will ring again next week. No bed at present. Just don't know. Anyway drums will arrive and this old fart @ mid fifties will be a new student lol My wife, not overly wrapt. Says whatever. You buy these things impulsively, boredom sets in, then you sell at a loss. I admit I'm always getting things but I get where my wife's coming from, she's the Rock and there's a bit going on. Best I can do is persevere at this.
Maybe we could call ourselves , The Misfits or are there any other suggestions. 
Cheers Velvet,
love your rationale at least you tried.Tiring for others around us as in keeping up with. Never a dull moment. I could easily bomb myself out other ways. Hope things work out. The Roller Coaster ride is a bummer but we are a resilient lot. I can sing a bit.....
like in the shower and now we have downsized to a newish smaller house the neighbours are so so close. I'm sure they think I'm a tad crazy when n full flight. It's funny as I'm getting older the more unhinged ve become. 
Loula good luck with the move, take care , look after that ankle. We moved house last year, first time in 35 years.. No regrets at all.
Rubyde sounds like you are young... Heaps of time to learn things but must admit similar vintage to Quirky and the years have flown and flying fast..
Tams no no lessons, hoping to learn from the pre programmed thingies in the machine. I tried the harmonica a while back got now where, played the clarinet in year 7 . Saxophones and drums were taken. So I'm hoping it's not to taxing to learn. I'm always tapping away on the steering wheel so hopefully I'm a natural. I just wanna have some fun. Tams you are a scream...hockey I'd miss the ball and hit myself. I truly would.
Wevve the makings of a supergroup. We need a name The fruit loops, the wannabees,
BP unmasked . Leave you callender free for touring and concerts. Who needs a manager ? we could manage ourselves ....Subject Matter experts Loula,
well done on the move. Can hear the relief, happiness in your post. You can put your feet up if you can. The best thing we done is move. I think I busted some tiles in the shower dropping shampoo bottle, go figure nothing is designed to last. Decided to go in hospital next week and get myself sorted. All over the shop. It's tiring. Just waiting on a single room . Need my peace and quite. Anyway decision is now made. Sick of the head games. Bit of Mindfullness and the other stuff will help. Suns shining, blue skies, Spotify playing chilled music. All good today, cheers 
  Hi folks,
spent a week in hospital. Glad to be out. Decided in consultation with my psych to try a change in meds as I've been elevated for a long time. I was toxic to this in the past so careful in watching water consumption levels. Well what a difference, I feel somewhat normal and calm. It's early days but I take a whole swag of meds nowadays. In time plan to reduce. Apart from hand tremors and the constant need to pee it's all good. I hope I don't react with this and it works out in the long term. All good onward and upwards 
cheers  Hi folks,
thanks Quirky, yes it's early days but a game changer. My mums birthday yesterday, no longer with us but was able to show emotion.
V. Excercising but eating a bit of crap. I've put weight on. It's not the end of the world.Trying to incorporate some yoga into my life. Downloaded a few apps but they were going way to fast for my little mind to digest.  Thank god for YouTube . I don't mind the hot weather but boy it's been hot. Thankfully today is a tad cooler. Garden and I can cope .
Rocketman emotional awareness have become more enlightened through courses, passages and ravages of time and the right mix of meds
cheers 
 
 
 
 
  Tams,
hugs from this neck of the woods. Be kind to yourself. Be honest with your psych. I have a pretty good relationship with mine and hope yours is the same.When it rains it pours and you have been snowed under.. Your meds might need a tweek or it just might need some insight from an expert. At the end of the day you are number 1..take care hope things  I wrecked my joints from long distant running. It was a different me who used to run. I'd run a pervervilile mile for a some chocolate, even a whiff of chocolate. I used to love licking the spoon whenever mum made cakes. I've got the munchies real bad. I blame the new meds hahaha but the're not the problem. 
Practice makes perfect in terms of venting. I'm turning into a grumpy old man according to the other half and very critical of others:(
gotta fight off the munchies Hello folks,
Usec to collect antiquarian books. No longer gave these books away ages ago. Tams you should post more often no preassure lol. You have great insight and articulate so well.
Quirky has that great ability as master of ceremonies to keep a lid or put everything into perspective.Been a bit lethargic and eating heaps with the new meds. Gotta preservere.see my psych next week. A walk is on the cards
cheers Yep, agree we are all sensitive here. We are allowed to be. Just back from my psych all good, additional meds. Shit excuse my French but I could open my own Chemist I kid you not. It's almost a bakers dozen of different colours to keep me on the straight and narrow.
Gotta walk. Brought my other half some chockies and a card for Valentines Day. Folks I'm ashamed to say this is a rare rare event. But better late then never. She's my rock and it's not easy living with me.
Coffea and Cake ... Yes please. I love a good sponge, or a chocolate cake, can't go past a lovelly vanilla slice. As you can gather easily pleased. In some aspects, in others never
cheers Feeling a bit blah blah,
adjusting to meds and having blood tests done. A bit lethargic and struggling in the heat. Eating lots and no Excercise. Was feeling pretty good but I'm a bit bushed. Will get through it. Have to cheers  Hi all,
pretty settled today lol. Smashed donuts, twisties and other munchies last week. New meds   supposed to help with appetite. Quite the opposite but it's a matter that of discipline for me. Haven't excercised for a few weeks. This heat has been taxing. Thinking of just living on vegies and beans and rice, buying a NutriBullet and doing the shake thing.
can relate to beeing in a total state of reflux as in up, down and in between. I don't have the extremes anymore but  this is as good as I'm going to get. 
Cheers  Hi Quirky,
did Mindfullness as part of a year long DBT course. It's something I try and do. I used to make an effort to do it daily but now it's hit and miss.Doing it online would do my head in... Not that it's that involved.  I did and have found it beneficial when I do it.
Velvet I hope things pick up for you. Take care Ice cream will eat it if it's there. Chocolate well I'd travel to hell and back for that. Velvet do tell... I've put on the weight that I lost prior to Xmas. Getting my haircut the other day and the barber explained how he changed to a vegan due to health issues and no turning back since then.. Well I'm not going vegan at this point in time but have started to and living on protein shakes. So in due course a soup and shake diet with the odd treat should work wonders. Well that's been the plan this week lol. Don't you love my commitment.? I've started excercising again now that the weather has improved though it's bloody cold.
Might be time for chocolate...., noooooo show some self control  Quirky,
yes ive tried that I think known as the soup diet as seen on a current affair. Stuck to it for a number of weeks. From what I recall it worked. Now trying protein shakes. It's pure convenience.
V take care and be kind to yourself. V.,
hopefully return to your old self soon Sounds like you getting the things you need done.Licorice yummm have some for me as well. Love chocolate coated Licorice bullets. Accidentally bought dark chocolate covered diring my last frantic dash up the supermarket aisles and loved it. Don't do Dutch Licorice simply not for me.Be kind to yourself. I think we are pretty good at picking ourselves up once the wheels fall off. It's a case of here we go again. It's tiring. Speaking of which I'm selling the drum kit. Another impulsive buy. Luckily my wife is pretty good about it. Anyway it's never a dull moment around us.
cheers  Susie,
we are brave and wonderful, you included. I try and walk every day. My little pooch demands  it. I try and ride or row indoors as well. Used to be very fit but my love affair with food, meds and could be a bit more disciplined. My little babies are in their 20s. The years have passed. Where have they gone? Lol. Cherish the good times. Time does fly. We sent to hell and back having kids. Losses along the way and it was absolute hell but worth it in the end. I've joined the local men's group , I'd say the youngest there but it's more for the social aspect.
Hows everything finding the  transition into Autumn? I'm getting ready for my Aitumn Winter vegies. Trying to lap up the remaining  Suns Ray's while I can. Autumns a nice time of year. Dreading Winter but gotta make the most of it.its awfully humid here , had some rare rain. Gotta go my little pooch needs his excercise ,
cheers Quirky,
velvet articulates it so well. Guess wth our meds, treatment and the constant battle we are so so aware at times of what we are going through. Being people please rs as well. I'm in my own little world most of the time. Medicated bliss not lol.
yumm stir fry veggies. I can handle that. Veggies, fruit and petrol pricy as . What a pain Susie,
i used to run lots when younger. wantec to run a marathon and did so with training. 30 + years later I try and walk, row indoors and cycle. It's all solitary stuff for me.  I eat way too much so it's a constant battle.Quirky nothing the matter with talking and reading. I used to devour books, now I struggle to read one. Hope you enjoy a good read in between selling a book or 2. My first job involved running a branch library. I was lucky to get 6 people in the morning. Didn't bother me I read books to kill the hours. Dream job and money for jam. Back in the good old days of flexitime.. How's the weather folks ? Beautiful here..
cheers For me,
constant tiredness , overeating or not eating. Feeling over it, I'm so over it now. I just want to crawl into a hole and dissapeared. A rare event , a massive fight with partner enroute to airport while dropping off son.  Not a happy Chappy at the moment,
cheers  As he devours a pack of dark chocolate licorice bullets and eyes of the donuts yummm
  Hi Quirky,
son was ok. Said stuff happens. It will be 12 months before I see him again. Life goes on. Not my best moment of being parent and spouse. An over analyser as well and at times so dismissive. Cheers
 Nothing the matter with having a mental health day. Choc bullet muffins... No sme things are best left alone, but then again no harm in trying. Love a muffin, love donuts even more, and nothing beats a vanilla slice. Daylight saving and the change n weather/ season trying to adjust, how are people doing ? More chockies over Easter yummo
cheers Velvet,
yes there is very soon and if I'm right there's one for you too. I crave food, junk food constantly these days. I think carbs, sugar are comforting. Not happy with the weight thing but I'm resigned to this love affair with food. Yo yo dieting and always excercising. I'm struggling to get out of bed. Love love my sleep and yet it's an escape. Autumns a nice time of year, Winters the pits and I love a little ray of sunshine . How about you guys?  Birthdays,
can relate with everyone being a milestone nowadays. Guess Quirky and I are the old farts in the group. Not that age matters. We're all stuffed it's just different grades. We are a resililient lot. Mindfullness is good. I don't do it often enough. Might be time to try an outpatient group to do it. Susie Rose I love your outlook on things.Off to take my 4 legged bestie off for a walk.He needs it and so do I. Loverly Autumn day for a walk
cheers National licorice day,
yummo gonna get some choc coated bullets, and other things to celebrate. Any excuse really to have a junk fix.School holidays here, quite as, guess all the people with young kids have gone away. Some more marvellous Autumn weather. Lapping it up. 
Cheers  In my haste to get out of the supermarket didn't realise I'd brought white chocolate raspberry coated bullets. Last time I did this come out with dark chocolate coated instead of my normal fare of milk chocolate bullets. Not the end of the world. They say to have a varied diet. Guess I'm doing my best. . Yummo Thanks Quirky,
i ate so much junk food  spent half the night feeling crook. I was so full. Will have to stop this binge eating. An expensive and not so healthy habit. I was pondering the other day momentarily thinking .... Have a lagh folks. How have people clued on that its my birthday.? Ddddddddrrrrrrrrr then the penny dropped . I kid you not. I'm paying a price for the Meds . Not being the most switched on chap anymore.  Gotta laugh at myself otherwise I'd be driven to tears. Upcoming birthday. It's just another day. I don't want any fuss. I don't really care. Will get through the day 
cheers Sponge cake,,, yummo,
Rapid cycling at the moment. Up and down all the time. Not at all grounded . I don't know what the issue is.Pity my loved ones it's not fair on them at all. Gotta ride it out. I hate being like this. It's so so tiring. Hope all is well with others cheers
 
  Congrats Jojo,
full of sponge cake, but happy to indulge in your celebratory cake. Nice dog photo. Are you a doggy person?
V my birthday has been and not the best of days. Picked up a bit late in the day but was so so over being me for much of the day. What tattoo ideas are you thinking of getting?im still wanting a psychedelic sleeve when I next go overseas.all subject to change including me
cheers Hi folks,
cute dog jojo. Full of beans. I've a black faced mini foxy whose birthday is a day after mine. He has helped me through my darkest moments. Loves his walks and if I'm not having the best day and bed bound will not rest and paces up and down the passage until I reappear.
Hope everyone has an enjoyable Easter. Kids make it with Easter egg hunts and the like. To me it's just another day.But that's me. Don't want to put a dampener on things. Enjoy, endulge. I've been giving hot cross buns a nudge,
cheers
 
 
 
  Tad ironic,
the black faced dog helping me fight the black dog. Rather pivotal in my decision to get him.  Quirky,
I tend to agree. It's only taken a few chocolate bunnies to find out. The kids brought us some quality chocolate eggs. I am full as a Goog. Don't want to see another chocolate egg EVER.  V,
i don't get sore muscles, only a sore backside . Something to do wth a great mass on that seat. I'm tired of trying to loose weight.  Anyway bike ride and a nice walk wth my better half tomorow. Cheers
  Hi there,
used to be an over thinker. Now I struggle to think at all. Must be the meds. I tend to be very intense in the moment and then n the next the previous is gone. Velvet a new bike . You go girl it's a great way to excercise, get some sun, feel the wind on your face. Have you bike paths close by? I'm a road  biker. MAMIL... Middle aged man in Lycra I am a slightly fat one at that. Although day 5 of being very careful about food intake after a cleansing medical procedure requiring lots of darting off to the loo.... You know the one. Not much fun but at least a clean slate to start on.im off for a ride while there's a bit of sun and the threat of rain. Be kind to yourselves
cheers Lucky you,
id better get into some serious training. I'd love to ride with you too. Nice conversation with the odd dash of sheer joy in hooning down a hill at top speed only to have a climb at the end of it. I could be a fossil . Fat old so and so in Lycra. Working on changing that one. Enjoy your weekend rides. I've a good path close by, council resealing the rest but I'm sticking to the roads ... Far safer.
Quirky the first time is the hardest. Good on you for getting on a bike. Try again, but only if you want to. My wife road once , before we were married on an oversized, men's bike, down my mums steep driveway across the lawn and into my mums prized daisies. It was hilarious to me at the time resulting in an argument and my wife never ever wanting to ride a bike since.... BTW don't let this story put you off.... I even suggested trainer wheels to my wife or a tandem bke and was promptly told where to go. Grumpy bumb I am .. Must be the meds or craving munchies.... Pop corn is my donut, chocolate, twisties replacement ... Far better for the new me
cheers Hello All,
this weather doesn't help. Windy, wet and cold so I didn't surface until 11:30. A day of nothing. Anyway Mothers Day coming up. Hope everyone has a good one. Will light a candle for mine and ensure the better half has a day centred around her for once
cheers  Quirky,
you would have to be a better runner then Bill Shorten. Now he has a really weird running action. Having said that I'd struggle to keep up with him :( Quirky,
i feel for you and gather you survived. Lovelly day outside I can't be bothered. Went spastic on FaceBook reaching out to former work colleagues and now rapidly unori ending. All over the shop. Will get through it. Hope all are ok,
cheers Hi,
just one of those wasted days. Son gave me a hug which helped bigtime.just sat on the couch, watched the idiot box, attacked fruit bowl and anything else within reach., I'm tired 15 sleep and wanted more. I know we all have these days and we get through them. Anyway enough my ranting. It will be ok 
cheers V,
take time out for yourself. You're number 1!. I'm not a fan on Winter. Taking my meds and then off to bed @ 7 cos it's dark. Little issues are big issues for us. You can talk to us here. We get one another. As in the whole group here. I love your excercise levels V. I wish I had your consistency. Finally went for a walk today. All my joints are sore as I haven't ridden or walked for a number of days. Winter hurry up, come and quickly pass. Not a happy chappy Hi All,
safe place for me is bed. Surfaced after 14 hours nap. A few dreams along the way. Struggled excercising yesterday. I'm so sore. All my joints are painful and no reason why. Sign of getting old. Anyway another ride today before Wnter arrives
cheers Velvet,
it really tires you out. I find it really tiring being me. If my better half knew what crap goes through my mind  on a daily basis she would say oh no not again. It's tiring. I'm pooped. Daily plans, trillions of them. The rollercoaster. Sleep . It's filled with dreams. I go to bed, same position every night, tense , go through some weird ritual of cracking fingers, toes and eventually fall asleep. I do a lot of emotional eating, lots and then try and balance it out with excercise. I hate taking the meds I'm prescribed. I'm on heaps. I'd like to go into hospital and get released from this Ferris wheel I live in.. I have no filters and can be tough on those around me. They deserve a medal. I'm all over the shop. Tiring for all concerned
cheers Don't know whether it's anxiety but I'm often on high alert. Guess it's the same thing. Easily startled by my wife or others. Hyper vigilant is probably another term. Sleep takes a while, when I do 12 hours, often dreaming, planning, not restful. Been busy in the garden. The rains great but all the weeds are coming up and saying hello. No such thing as a maintenance free garden , gotta go suns out  asdff yep it goes with the territory. I can notice some of the most bizarre stuff, can hear a pin drop. Anyway good on you for going to Gym. Excercise helps, there's a few excercise junkies here. I am really really feeling my age with aches and pains. All of a sudden with the onset of Winter I'm aching. I guess it's the old adage you gotta keep moving. Good attention to detail I'd say :)
 
 
  Continuousventer ,
welcome to this nutty side of BB. Will pass on the Singapore chicken curry unless it's home made. Yummm love the burger and it's been a long time since I've indulged in a take away burger. Brought some magnums for tonight as in ice creams as opposed to those that go bang bang. Hope the weathers nice in everyone's neck of the woods and you able to enjoy. Lovelly Winterl 14 degrees and another productive day gardening. The body really feels it now :(  Hi folks,
i know I'm not quite right. The other night I was was aware mid dream that I was making kookaburra calls n the middle of my sleep. Asked my wife the following morning to confirm and yet , making bird calls. Nutty as hey. I was never popular at school. During my working life was likeable. Chapters in your life .... Nooo not me,
its been a long time since I've been in a tree... I'd fall off. Yep I've forever playing things in my head, along with finger tapping, singing out loud. I think I've got a voice. Now I'm fixated on my new tattoo to get when overseas. A psychedelic inspired theme. Gotta few ideas.. I'm pooped by the end of the day. Gotta take the pooch for a walk. We both need it so much. Might have half a chance of a good nights sleep V,
you go girl. Hell have no fury like a woman scorned. Not a laughing matter. It's had to believe in this day of age that it's still goes on. Sounds like you digging you're heels in and sticking to your guns. Keep on gathering your evidence and they won't have a leg to stand on. Aerobics ... I'd do that... Though I think you would be hard pressed to keep a straight face at my attempts. I think due to my meds, Dvancing years ., any excuse really I'd be 2 seconds ahead or 2 seconds behind. Best I leave it to the experts.
asdf ..... You articulate it so well. Feel so different to others. React differently to others. Varying degrees. Hope you have a better day tomorow. 
Cheers Hi folks,
Quirky, I love your description of bipolar. I've never done a aerobics class. Didn't know they still existed. We Bipolars don't do things by halves. Hats off to those around me. Lucky I have a supporting and understanding family.  There's a ray of sunshine outside. Will have to wwalk the dog as I didn't yesterday... Resulting in a very restless sleep. 
  1.5 hours in and the heavens opened up. 1.5 hours back in the rain. Dog quickened his step as the rain got heavier. Nice shower for me and towel dried the pooch
asdff I struggle around that time. Not so much depression or the blues but tense and on a knifes edge regardless of what has transpired throughout the day. Long sunny days in Summer work a treat. Not a fan of Winter Quirky,
im not that young. Excercise, walking the dog. Trying to survive Winter. It's ok as long as I'm moving. As a kid I secretly wished I was a year older and coudnt wait to grow up. Now feeling every bit my age. Lucky you V , my new GP thought I was 10 years older then I am and would have given me a different flu shot. I was floored for a few days. I'm not vain lol I've smoked on and off over the years, have a rare drink, look my age when I'm weighty and not when I peel it off. Working, married and paying off a mortgage by 22 and umpteen years later still married.SHE deserves a medal. We work well together, rarely fight and today's a good day. Went for a ride, started to go for a walk and the heavens opened up. Winter is putting on quite a display outside.. Lovelly sunset..... I don't act my age... Can be so politically incorrect. The weather might be dull but we certainly aren't  Hi folks,
suffer from PTSD.20+ years of working for DOJ, but that's ok.V I should have excercised yesterday. Walked but could have done more. Today forecast for rain. Tomorow see my psych. Might run the idea of weaning myself of 99% of my meds. I'm on lots.See what she says. She is the subject matter expert and we have a very good rapore with one another, 
cheers Food ,
Whereis it ? Back from psych. Gradually changing meds. Trying a different antidepressant. My MEDS make me eat. A ravenous appetite, donuts cinnamon X 12 just for me, iced donuts yum yum,chocolate all make me feel good but all so guilty afterwards. Sometimes I can't even be bothered eating but have gone to the fruit bowl numerous times. As I said to my psych I am never full. I have a wee problem with food. Here comes the sun, For tomorrow May rain, so today I'll follow the sun, Here comes the sun..... I need the sun. Used to be a beach person, daily long runs but no more. More meds changing over.  One day hopefully medication free.  V,
you are so right. It's exhausting living the extremes, noticing the things we do. It's so full on. I've rested today, just watched a great bob Dylan doco on Netflix and farted around with my bike. Some things that were so easy once to do simple things I find confusing. I'm in a good headspace a the moment right now. New meds but only 1 weeks supply at a time as my psych had concerns. All good :) Hi Folks,
Imagine if we had surgery to make us live longer. They do, how about a little nick which could add a predetermined amount on your life. As this point in time I wouldn't put  my hand up. What about others ? Too many relevant questions. Dr DooLITTLE runs the other way.V that's pretty cool. That generation were and are pretty remarkable.My mother passed away in her early 80s from Dementia, a horrid ending. I don't think I will make it to her vintage. If I do well and good..
off for a walk to find the fountain of youth cheers Cake did someone mention cake?
I love cake... Most foods actually. Worst advice about bipolar. Wasn't given any. Most of the advice I've found online or here. Just back from the nursery. Pink vanilla slice and coffee. I am full.  Quirky,
i guess because I was diagnosed only a few years ago. Just finished a few domestic chores and need to get out and walk the pooch. Aren't pets great. I get the greatest welcome from my dog, rain, hail or shine. The days are getting longer now. Roll n Spring and Summer V,
you rock, an early morning gym workout, wow that's discipline. Dragged my dog along for 10 ks, mostly off the lead, so it was magic. Wanted to bike ride but walked instead. I need to get out on the bike. Thank god for endorphins  Quirky,
i used to be a good deal lighter then I am now, although I excercise a bit am overweight.I blame the meds but there not to blame. But I'm ok with that. V I feel for you. I used to work in an environment where it was , if you don't like it there's the door, or suck it up princes.
i feel for you. you are pretty resilient to still be working there with the many obstacles in place and despite everything enjoy the work you do. You are number one and look after yourself in the process. ... Get a dart board, picture of your boss and others, handful of darts and say cop this. Or xcecise as you do , and don't give in, Be kind to yourself, not fun working for bullies V,
good on you for speaking your find, and Megahugs if I can. Quirky sounds like you are very good at reading people. I aren't. . . I haven't moved today from the couch only to feed the dog and pig out on junk. Had the best plans but couldn't, just couldn't. Full of excuses, windy, it might rain but it's ok. Tomorows another day. Hope it's a good one for all concerned I'd rather be too happy rather then the alternative. I was doing ok but I wasn't a while back. I've had a change in new meds and a reduction in others. I've noticed an increase in mood rather then flatlining.
V you're allowed a mental hhealth day Yu know and yours is a legitimate sicky.
im trying to be good day 1 of logging food, excercise .Enjoy the sunshine .  Hello all.
Tams 20 great to see you back. I've had a bit of trouble adjusting to new meds. Determined to  medication free eventually.  I'm trying intermitant fasting . Early days set but I can be pretty good if I focus, All or nothing. Anyway started on the 5/ 2 where you restrict your calories for 2 days and eat normally for the 5. Anyway I tried fasting for 20 and eating for 4. Quality food though rather then junk. I can now fast between 22-24 hours and have 1 meal a day. There's a lot of literature out there. It's working for me and that's the main thing. 
All good in my neck of the woods, my wife says I'm grumpy buts that's ok.  Wonder how Loula is doing. It's nice to see some new faces,
cheers  Hi Quirk
this way of fasting during that period, water, black coffee are basically it. If you use a sweetener, sugar you get a spike. Basically your body has 2 states, eating and fasting. Long term 5/2 diet is the way to go,When you reach your goal weight you mix it up changing the fasting period, decreasing it as well so you're body is a constant state of confusion. Michael Mosley has a great webpage and forum with a wealth of info. For me it wouldn't matter how much or how little I ate, I don't have hunger pains. Don't know whether it's my medication as I would feel hunger . As Velvetfaeries colleagues say there's a lot of data out there. 
It's still early days and my psych will probably go off as its a pattern of all or nothing but I'm sick of the constant yo yo of my weight. Personally I'm surprised how easy it's so easy for me to have a lengthy fast with no ill effects. 
We will see how long I can maintain it, but I plan to mix it up and not beat myself over it,,
cheers  Tams,
I've been cycling  for 20 years. Having a few issues with my meds affecting the way I cycle.Glad you enjoy it . Lots of info on the web. Also I don't buy my gear locally if I can Wiggle from Uk and always at my door within 9 days and big saving compared to Aus.
Aussie cycling forum full of info. It's pretty addictive and I wished I discovered cycling earlier as I wrecked my body through long distance running and then fell into cycling.
Velvet we can start a group. I did the Ride Around the Bay a couple of times and hopefully will do once again, Wo could get some jerseys custom made , have a few circles on them and call ourselves the Fruit Loops. Another day of 22 hours fasting and 2 hours of eating.Early days and I hope I'm not stuffing up my insides. Excercise free day today, no walk,ride or row. Watching the idiot box, but all good
 cheers Quirky,
your not old. I remember janis Joplin. Very good doco on Netflix about her . Very interesting.
Tams your not mucking around. What sort of bike do you have? I will take my dog for a walk after I do the domestic chores.  Haven't ridden since Sunday. Something off with my circulation. Hands are freezing, feet not feeling right on the car. I'm ok I n the auto. I don't think it's related to my fasting( 22 hours and 2. Seeing my dr tomorrow. Even my last ride and before struggled to engage pedals . In 20 years of cycling this is a first. Anyway enough of my nagging,
cheers Tams,
im impressed, that's a nice bike and the things you need or might need add up. Having said that you have to be comfy. Once in  winter I road with the only gloves I had and my fingers froze. I had tears streaming down my face. Another time it was a night time ride, again in Winter, and the quicker I went the colder I got. A few purchases and I could ride in anything.i have a Treck Danome S. Love the disc brakes. I used to ride lots. Have other options, a decent spin bike, rowing machine and other bits and peices.  44ks straight off is pretty good. I've some bike paths close by but prefer the roads. Was going to ride today but the roads are wet  I'm a fair weather cyclists these days. I'd  love to hear how your rides go. You might be the next Anna Meares.
cheers Hi folks,
v, pack as much in, while caring for yourself or don't feel guilty doing nothing all. It's freezing outside and windy so indoors for me. My intermitant fasting is working a treat. Black coffee and water  and a 2 hour eating period is working a treat. I've Brought an air fryer, best thing since sliced bread. Now awaiting accessories from eBay so there's more Sh*t in the pantry. I'm enjoying the longer days lol , roll on Spring And Summer but I guess that's wishing your life away. I'm enjoying Winter and embracing every day.Have a good one folks I'm pretty sure all of my family know, and possibly a few friends. I can't really remember. ive no desire to tell anyone else. Has anyone tried air fried sweet potato chips. Yummy as. Dragged my dog along for a 14 km walk. Wore my dry as a bone, loaded my pockets with dog treats for the dog not me. I figure I can't run anymore, the dog and I need a walk and there will come a day when I can't walk. All good in my neck of the woods for now cheers Thanks Quirky,
just avoided the showers during today's walk. Had to carry my dog home towards the end as he had lost his harness towards the end. Don't know where as it took a while to register and it's probably down a rabbit hole. Anyway thanks to EBay another's on its way. It's freezing here, not as in snow but cold all the same.
asdf lots of workplaces have a long way to go.They might tick the boxes but when push comes to shove they don't deliver. I will never work again. I'm just thankful I don't have to put up with that crap anymore.
i find people tiring. I find myself tiring . I pity those around me trying to keep up with me. I can barley keep up with me.
cheers Adff,
thats enough to do anyone's head in. I know we do what we can for our kids. By the sounds of it they sound young. When it rains it pours. Be kind to yourself. I thought I was ticking along quite nicely, though my loves ones tell me be been grumpy, swearing more then usual. Put it down to new meds and other changes in meds. 
Velvet , have a lovely break. My little pooch is a mini foxy. I dragged him along for another walk, looking all along for his harness and I found the blasted thing. 6 ks in and a fluke. We've managed 35 ks in 3 days. Time to hit the rower  and bike cos blisters on feet and legs feeling it. Loosing weight still thanks to fasting, quality foods and a bit of excercise.
See my psych in a few weeks and hopefully sort out my meds. Loss of confidence with a few things. I need changes. At least the weather is starting to pick up.
Yelmel, welcome aboard. Supportive lot here who get one another
cheers Tams20,
ouch can relate perfectly. I've gone down like a bag of S***t a couple of times over the years. Tis funny how you miracously unclick when you hit the ground. You just dust yourself off and get back on the bike. We've all done it. It certainly wakes you and you loose that false sense of security. All part of the fun. Though will keep my distance from you on the soccer pitch as well (only joking). Back on my regular meds. New meds was making my driving and cycling erratic. It was a tad scary. Been watching what I eat and intermitant fasting paying dividends. Roll on Spring and Summer. Bit cold:(
V  I hope the new eyes are working well. How long is the recovery?. I'm lost without my glasses. Especially after the wrong side of 50. Not much fun but still kicking along,
cheers Velvet,
im sorry I missed what was going on. Megahugs from this neck of the woods. Be kind to yourself. Do whatever you have to do to look after number 1 ( you). I'm not the best with words.
Quirky you're a legend and steer us from the bridge.its great to see the sunshine here in Vic. Hope it's not to bright for you V.
Jemma, hope we can help you here. It must be so hard for the partners, spouses of Bipolars. I sound flippant, go off on tangents, need new things, been to hell and back and again, and on it goes. Having said that its such an individual thing with treatment, meds, couselling and time we can be treated. I'm glad you found us here. My pooch needs a walk,  just surfaced from bed and got to get my daily fix,
cheers  Hi folks,
 I can be messy and then tidy. Depends on where my attention is. I can totally focus on something and then loose attention, focus on something else and give it my all. Food, excercise, EBay , you name it. I indulged yesterday food wise. Ice cream, pancakes, lovelly salmon for dinner. Now back on intermitant fasting. Whacked on a couple of Kgs this week but all good. I'm tired, today now I understand what a food coma is. 
V I'm still getting my head around Facebook. Reaching out to a few people but guarded about how much personal info I do. Roll on the warmer weather. I'm cold but it's not so cold outside. Tomorrows another day ,
cheers Hi folks,
just back from a long walk with my pooch. A really rough day at the office yesterday. Tears, felt really flat, emotional eating and blindsided. Thought here I go again. Put in down to medication changes and just in a shitty place. It was horrible. But that was yesterday. Not fantastic today but feeling ok. Trying to keep busy and put it behind me. Hope others are having a good day and if not realise that things do improve,
cheers Thanks velvet and quirky for the kind thoughts,
a bit better, going for long walks daily, and then eating badly. It's like a game of tennis with me being the ball. I find myself Latelly living in the past, searching for old friends, school friends on face book and thinking of my life that has past, reminysing. It's a bit of a shitty ecistance. Possibly adjusting to medication change and I want to be medication free. Who am I kidding.  
Velvet, you go girl. Apart from my long walks I'll pick it up once the weather warms. I need those endorfins. It's amaysing what they do. Velvet pretty inspiring stuff you're doing. 
Cheers Quirky,
trying to find old school friends on FB and then despondent when no reply. It's a bit of a battle at the moment.  Got the munchies at the moment. Thankfully walking everyday but it's a bit of a bummer.  Rapid cycles.Mood swings. It's tiring really tiring . 
Cheers  Velvet,
love your rationale. Still have the munchies, walking every day so that's a constant. Catching up with an old school friend. Haven't seen each other for over 30 years.still up and down like a yo yo and massive migraines as well,,but hey tomorow  is another day and the sun will be out. Another walk and gotta get through it. Hope others are doing ok.V enjoy the cake, hope it's a good one :) Quirky,
touched base via FB. It might be a meeting punctuated by awkward silence. Anyway locked in now. Back from a long long walk. The doc and I are pooped. No comfort food today so far so good,
cheers  Velvet,
you do rock and you do roll. Your posts have such insight and a fun spin despite how dire things are. Music, Pizza and beer what a combo. Quirky I cope with eating always have. Saw my psych today and I'm adamant I will try and get medication free , even for a day down the track. My last med changes floored me, overeating, mood swings that sort of suff. Hopped on the scales and I've put on a kilo or 2. That's ok that's what happens when you stuff yourself. Still fasting everyday and long term will get the weight off and keep it off. Pooped, long walk with my pooch , followed by a quick row on my machine. My legs are burning which is good. Great to see the sun. So so looking forward to sunny days, daylight saving and increased excercise levels. My knee is protesting, old age is catching up,hope everyone is doing ok.
cheers Velvet,
thats shocking news on both fronts. Confronting in so many ways. Remember, try and be kind to yourself. Listen to your body. A day on the couch sounds like a good medicine. Take care .
Quirky at least you do things. It certainly does take longer to do things but that's just part of getting on. Eventually we will stop but that's a while away yet.
cheers No quirky,
somewhat subdued and sensible I'd say with the capacity to run amok . As for me it's been a long while since I've been wild. Usually with a little Dutch courage and not with my meds. the last time I had a few at a family function , l was free flowing with my language. That's about it lol. Do it while you can V it's pretty booooring past 50. Quirky and I are similar vintage . As for people I used to be pretty trusting. Now there's not many in my life. I've let a few ex work colleagues in , very few and to be quite honest I have better conversations with my dog. At least he shows interest.People are hard work and im in my little world. It's official I'm NQR Quirky,
inferring you are not old.Sorry misread feeling old to as I am.NQR is an acronym for Not Quite Right. Folks have you tried melatonin , a natural herb to aid sleep. I've been on it for a number of years and it helps. I have some crappy nights sleeping , but then some good ones. 
Quirky , that must be tiring. I hope you get a good nights sleep more often . Washing machine minds would be great to unblug it now and then Aren't eyes the window to your soul or something like that. I usually  stuff things up these days. Green eyes wicked . Mine are blue. Do they change ? I don't know. I reckon if I'm sad my eyes aren't intense. Back from a bike ride. Lovelly in the sun. But I smashed twisties and biscuits this morning watching NetFlix then dragged myself off the couch and got moving. I'd be fit as a fiddle if I didn't have the munchies. Oh well  maybe soon lol.
Lily18 are you under the care of a good psychologist or Psych? A good one makes the world of difference. An understanding GP is a rarity.Plus it's not their expertise.
cheers  Issi,
welcome back. I'm tired . I missed the 3rd quarter of the Grandfinal asleep on the couch.
A couple of days of no excercise, couple of weeks of bad diet choices and I slept badly for 2 days. Bad dreams, l kicked my wife in the leg during the night( kicking a ball) she said ouch you kicked me. I replied I know I kicked a ball. Off to Bali for a few weeks. Sun , nice food and a book and then home,... I feel so sick. Ate so much crap watching the footy :( Not even my team 
cheers 
  Hi All,
ive become very judgemental and less tolerant. Shoyldnt watch the news as its all bad , sick of the quips the newsreaders make and turning into a right old fart. Excercising, eating and off for a short holiday  , Yumm Food, heat and massages. Then hit my groove once I get back. That's the plan..... Hangon I live day to day,
cheers Quirky,
thanks, will be ok once I get there. My better half deserves a relaxing break. Have to watch alcohol and food choices. Bad experience last year.
V that's great news about your friend on IVF. We went through the rollercoaster ride that is IVF 30 years ago. So glad that this one stuck. Day light saving coming that will take some adjusting to. Roll on the warmer weather,
cheers  Hello Quirky,
i don't feel guilty, rarely as its all about me. So self centred and focused on me. Been hete a week and debating on another tatoo. Cheaper to get at home and far less hassle. Common sense says wait so hopefully common sense will prevail. Cheers Quirky,
its never too late to get a tatoo.will get mine done at home. Resist temptation. Constant craving seeing satisfaction. Something never gained,
cheers I go through the motions most days. Matter of survival I guess. Day by day and even on holidays going through motions. 30 degree days here every day. Looking forward to going home. My pooch will be so so excited. Diet starts again. All I've lost I put back on. It started to come back on weeks before overseas trip. I've eaten so so much. Bali food improved so much ,
cheers  Hi folks,
waiting for plane... It's been a good break but time to head home. Touch wood no Bali belly. I've been crook most of our Indonesian, Thailand, Aisian trips. No alcohol this trip, not a big drinker at all and extra careful with my meds. Food, breakfast included for free so watermelon, pineapple, juices, omelette and usually some Nash goring. Nothing for lunch and then dinner no shortage of places by the beach and on the street. Mostly Western , Indonesian . last night and night before wicked seafood sates, an arms length long. Great juices, smoothies really catering for the health conscious so I've been loving the juices. Can't wait to get home in dire need of prune juice enough said. I gather the weathers not so flash in Melbourne. At least the gardens watered. It's been a good break but time to head home 
cheers  Quirky,
great juics to be had as many of the fruit not available in Aus. As for alcohol when I do usually at family functions I become loud and over the top. I don't drink when overseas or cruising as its not worth the risk. Alcohol and meds don't mix. 
Cheers Hi folks,
anxious as a kid, but carefree as well.Anxious as an adult as well, but had to be to be high functioning , ( that's a judgement again, we gotta stop that). Definatelly related to Bipolar. Overthink most things.eg. Just brought a vac, now looking at other vacs, buying bags for the vac , even looking at making them.... Now whats the next thing lol. ... On another note saw a great film... Judy.... About Judy Garland....Renee Zelwigger brilliant . Judy didn't stand a chance the movie big wigs were feeding her pills, watching her weight, dictating her sleep. Pity the me too movement wasn't around then. Tragic to die @ 47. Anyway a good flick,
cheers Quirky
im sure there's a book out there.As for me I know when eating clean I'm ok. At the moment and for a while not the best diet choices. Same correlation with excercise or not. All or nothing, the extremes for me. Walked the pooch in the rain and hail. Magic to see nature at the extremes. The sun came out between showers and eary to see the steam rise and the path dried. Very aerie. Good to get it done, one day though ,
cheers  Decisions, deciosions,
i can make them, spur of the moment stuff and at times all consuming. I only make a few, but in reality we make 1000s a day without realysing. Thanks theraphy... Remembered that lol,
cheers  Haha Quirky,
now im confused lol. I don't make many decisions as in big ones and if I did I can be rather flippant about it. I'm very impulsive, don't know what's going to come out f my gob next. I guess as my world has become rather small, decisions are less so. I just go with the flow. Sounds pretty cruisy but it's not  ,
cheers Binge on Netflix when I can. Some of the shows are a bit weird but each to Thier own. I'm doing a lot of comfort eating. Hard to commit to xcecise, diet etc. seeing my psych next week. Want to cease meds in hospital early next year. If it fails resign myself to taking this cocktail of meds forever. Velvet I hope you're on the mend. Be kind to yourself. 
How do people find Xmas, New Year and the festive season? I used to be a fan especially when kids were little. I could give it a miss. It's not at our house this year. Last year I was putting plates away, cleaning up  before guests left. Was not a popular person at all.Lookng forward to some warmer weather. 
cheers  I'm sure my psych will recomend that's it won't be the wisest move . 
Those closest do listen but theve heard it all before. Plus I think it's pretty tiring being around me . I'm hard work. 
Cheers  Hell All,
bipolar is tiring, so so tiring. Here I am looking at the citrus tree, needs a trim its been trimmed but still not perfect. Looking around the yard  , not a weed in sight but seeking perfection. Constantly overthinking everything. It scares me but it doesn't with some of the stuff going through my head. The chemist knows me so so well with my frequent flyer points collecting meds. I've reached out to people, but now withdrawing. I just can't be bothered with 99% of people. They wouldn't know. I see my psych tomorow for our catchup. I'm tired. I'm here for a good time, not a long time. What's a good time ? Lol Velvet,
always here for a chat. We Bipolars get one another. Walk a mile in my shoes. We all do.Back from the psych. More meds lol. And I wanted to get off them. I think not. Way to hard and my psych says we want to avoid the slippery slope I was sliding down. Option of TMS but meds first option. Only thing is new meds might react with a few others. Discussion with Chemist.
Velvet be kind to yourself.When your ready I'm sure you will bounce back into your excercise. I need to get back into it. Managed a walk and shortly do the domestic chores. Not a cook but pretty mean with a vac. 
Cheers Hi All,
i re Kon we would make a rip snorter of a film. All with staring roles. Is that spelt right lol.i know when I have a normal day , I need a rest the following. Especially on holidays when I need to escape for a day in the cabin  ( when cruising ). Love a day all to myself . Complete blackness . Then I'm good. Pity the poor bugger in Bali declared his ADHD med and then was busted for it. I was on that for years before Bipolar diagnosis. Now I'd need my own plane for the amount of meds I'm on. Well into double figures. New meds making a difference, which is good. I have a great psych, supportive family and a great lot here.
Quirky,  
how far back do you rewind? My initial thought was to the start but no. Some decisions I've made not the best. Or fast forward quickly that's a horrifying thought. Maybe Mark time lol, munching away on Tim tams yummmmo  Hi All,
some of my meds make me have nightmares. I'm on another to combat this. Bullets yummmmm a weakness of mine.
Robin Williams come back. He could play me to a tee,
sadly missed Hi All,
i can hear a pin drop but struggle at times to hear my wife hahaha some might call it selective hearing, I have a heightened sense of smell. Pick,when clothes washed with a different brand, yesterday whole yard smelt like something died not me and my wife couldn't smell a thing. I'm napping on the couch for a good couple of hours a day. Might be new meds or daily walks caching up with this old fart. One day I'm good to go productive n the yard, xcecise and the like and the next lucky to get a walk in.
Like you asdff , I've had a few years of theraphy 3 and another year ahead along wih various treatments and med changes. I'm also lucky, wife is stable, planner, the kids and my go too and somehow 35 years have flown by and still together. I'm tired gotta try and keep busy. Caught up with an old work colleague and swapped war stories. hopefully get the pushy out over the weekend. All this comfort eating is starting to show ...
cheers Last year Xmas at our house. Mid arvo and I'm clearing tables, packing up while guests are still here. I was not popular at all.So thankfully Xmas at sisters in laws. Will try and make a des Crete exit lol. Wife has put up tree and stuff. Looks good , she's happy. Hurry up 2020 Partying hard,
for me hard to party but if I was to do so , I'd be pretty full on and then lie low for a year. Quirky yes just about to walk my pooch in the cold. It's only him and me some days. 
Cheers  Quirky,
i will fan the winds the other way. Stay safe bloody fires.is anyone missing a pet snake. Was in LaLa land trying to stay upright on my bike in a gale and this big snake is in front of me. Luckily I hit his back with my front wheel, I screamed  rather loudly and the rest of my ride was not the same. Next a blasted blowfly get in between my glasses and face, that scared me too. Who said riding on a bike path was safe. Will be super vigilant for the rest of Summer. Day 1 of trying to get 2 lots of excercise am and pm to loose weight and feel good.
Velvet, Corellas are such an intelligent bird. I used to try and breed a few varieties of birds years ago. Love seeing our fauna out there on  a daily basis. Bring on the warm weather. Snakes alive I hope not. I now know I made the right decision in keeping my pooch on a lead over summer  Hi Folks,
the snake seemed OK. It must have felt the touch of the wheel and pushed off into the scrub. You realise how powerful and beautiful they are if you've had a python or other around your body. Glad both ok. V I walked today planned to ride or row but wached catchup tv. Intense excercise or any xcecise makes a diff. Will get condistant in the new year.thats the plan anyway.   Quirky,
there you go, you wouldn't know.... On that note we would write some pretty interesting memoirs . Decades before diagnosis, risky behaviour, addiction to excercise,rocked up,to a run ciggy in mouth, loved running marathons, running at midnight early hours of the morn. Pretty dull really, now it's singing full pelt, stupid stuff. I've mellowed but I'm tired too. 
I don't what I'd be . My diagnosis 3 years back, similar vintage to quirky and all over the shop . One more Xmas catchup and I'm done. Then I can crawl back into my little bubble 
cheers Hi All,
cant believe , though not surprised, how similar we all are. Not many get us but we do. Quirky sounds like you are well read. I'm pleased when I can complete a book . 
cheers Quirky,
in between working in justice and libraries talk about extremes, I'd love reading. Over the years I would read a book and then reread it years or months later. Asdff there was an author who wrote the complete book of running. Jim Fix. Got people hooked on running, former smoker, fat guy you get the picture. I always wanted to run The Boston Marathon, you had to qualify and the history of the whole event. I do miss running, being fit and bombproof but I can work on being fit  ,cheers Oh wow,
it's must be that attention to detail. Go the Dewey decimal system. Qualified Library Technician here haha. Some of my most cherished employment. It's a bit uncanny isn't it.All our minds in overdrive and then at times a grinding halt. Another ride in the wind, restful sleep. I do need excercise, a daily dose to add to my medication requirements. Hope all are surviving this weird weather. Wintery here in Vic.   A walk with my pooch and a row on my rowing machine. 
Cheers
  Hi folks 
I wouldn't know. Stopped working in libraries in 95 and cataloging was more the Librarians domain wherever I worked. Dewey stuck in my head as I used to stack the shelves with returned read books and some students made a hell of  a mess.
asdff  that brings back memories with the school concerts. So much fun but as the years passed a tad repetitive .Hope you had a good workout. I walked, cycled indoors and rowed. Geez it felt good. Today's a longer walk and a ride.Trying to get 2+ hours excercise a day. Need to loose weight for holiday and long term my health.
Velvet , sounds pretty full on. Man, kids and other stuff. I love your descriptive posts and the intensity . We are all in the same boat. Caffeine , my bumb is glued to the seat, my Nike beckons before I find an excuse,
cheers Tinza,
takes guts to write poetry and its such a personal thing. Welcome. Ive spent some time in Clinics both private and public and now do outpatient courses. It all helps but I get great support here. Many post 
 cheers ì Tinza, find them beneficial , everyone's in the same boat, and at the very least it's a social gathering. Some engage, others do drawing as they listen. I'm pretty tired as I concentrate,try and take it in, that sort of thing. I've had enough of the current one. Pooped a long walk, row and spin bike, only to eat like a pig a few hours later:(
cheers Hi folks,
excercised, felt a tad easier on the bike, but pissed hat info hit and miss on Strava. It's all about numbers. Quirky Strava is a fitness app. Banana Smoothie went down well , good all day and then bam choc chip bickies, BBQ shapes and protein bar. Xmas and new year touch food wise. Caught up with old work colleague, apparently another former work colleague spilled the beans at my former work place, couldn't help themselves to blah blah blah. Time to be gaurded yet again.Got an assesses net coming up for an outpatient program next year. Should be good . Anyway tomorrow's another day . Hope all are ok,
cheers Hi folks,
happy on my wedding day, the birth of kids, like others flickers of happiness. I don't think we live in a normal world. We see things differently. I overthink every bloody thing. Every day it's another line in the sand. That's the way it is for me. Try and structure a few activities a day , excercise , garden but by 5 I start undoing it all by hoing into food. It's tiring, so so tiring. My wife and kids deserve a medal. I've a good psych and my cocktail of meds helps me get through the day. I get pleasure out of nature, the smell of a tree, that sort of thing. A few years ago I couldn't even look in the mirror. I'm a shell of my former self but that's ok. Would I wish bipolar on anyone no ,
cheers Hi all,
Quirky hope things get busy, sure they will. Xmas is coming around quickly , too quick for me, then it's over. A few gatherings to endure then back to my little den. . My son loves buying series of gaming books , dungeon and dragons and other series books. They look impressive.  I plan to read a book on cruising holiday. Once I could devour a book in 24 hours, now sometimes years or not at all :( Quirky,
dtumbled across previous pOst re stick vac... Yes I'm addicted it's an lg, the dysons relegated to car duty. The only issue like a lot of things built a few cm too short. Not like the good old days with a Hoover.  It's shocking what's happened over in NZ. Mother Nature at its worst, bit like the bush fires. They had a minutes silence at the cricket. My BP mind thinks if they did that in the US every time they had a mass shooting the whole country would come to a standstill and not move for a long long time. Those poor people, a horrible way to go and a long long road ahead for the survivors  . Velvet,
i feel your pain. Don't miss the workplace functions. A couple of ciders and I'm gone. Haha I'm right off , NQR - and politically incorrect after a few of those.
Quirky, I used to marvel at the antiquarian books when working at the State Library. steeped in history, I had  a Shiite job, a domineering tyrant of a boss and some of the staff there shit didn't stink.
asdff, don't know how you guys stand the heat , here it's the extremes and the blasted wind. It's been overly windy here, overly hot and dry elsewhere along with the bushfires. You gotta love a sunburnt country. My bike beckons as there's a lull in the wind,
cheers Just wanted to stop by and say hi.
My wife suffers from bipolar and I've been doing a lot of reading in trying to understand the illness. I do go from being the most amazing husband in the world to the worst husband in the world with her illness. 
It's sad to see but I do everything I can to let her know I'm there for her and would do anything for her and not let this illness destroy us. 
Unfortunately her kids have placed an enormous amount of stress on her and this has caused her to leave me which has been devastating. This has sent me into a deep depression, anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. 
I want to follow this thread and get some feedback from people with bp. Is her illness going to keep her away from me because of the stress put on by her children or will she finally see what has happened and try to make a mends? 
Its been very interesting reading how everyone with bp copes differently. I wish my wife would not have given up on me being by her side.  Thank you Tony and Kaz for your reply. 
Kaz I believe she is type 1. She has been very depressed lately from the added stress about missing out on her kids weddings. 
She has only started treatment in the last month but we are only starting to understand the illness and that she needs medication not only for her highs but also for her lows. 
She did mention that the medication was starting to work on her highs as she has been on that medication longer but not her lows. 
The problem now is I cannot contact her because of her restraining order which kills me. 
She always tried to tell me I'm better off without her and I always tried to let her know that I would be worse off without her and I'm right. I'm a complete mess and can't function properly. 
Tony, I'm not blaming just the illness. Her kids have placed so much stress on her and she knows that because we have spoken about it. She just gets to these points that she doesn't see any better at what devastation she causes when she is like this. She always tried to convince me she was bad and no good for me. She is an amazing woman and i love her deadly. I just can't tell her that anymore till she makes contact with me. She is worth all the pain and suffering because i know who she is when she is normal. 
Thanks.  dear Kaz, I'm so sorry that now you are struggling with this terrible illness once again, it's prolific and you never know when you are going to hit a low,and when it happens it's too late to even try and stop it, which I don't know whether this could even happen, so it's another wave no different than when you were trying to give up the grog, but ones an addiction and the other is an illness, two which are completely different, but not when it distrupts your life.
You know what bipolar does to you so try and keep an even keel when you are having a downer.
My thoughts are with you. L Geoff. x Dearest Kaz
I am not sure what to say, but I am just leaving a hug here for you.💟
Love

  Hi Guys,
I have bipolar and going through pure hell at moment. The Deppresion OMG it sucks! The not being able to do daily tasks sucks! Having to actually think now how will this task effect me sucks! It just sucks!!! 
I decided to go back on lithium as I've been doing it in my own strength for 9 months but I'm now in a situation in a new job where I can get where I want to be professionaly and I thought I'm not stuffing this up. I'm going to be a winner! 
BIG mistake!!! Im home from work sick! I have all the symptoms to early stage lithium posioning!!! 
I worked on it all week with people coming up to me going you don't look well, your pale, your making silly mistakes. Then the security guard came up to me and said I've been watching you and your zoning in and out. Your eyes are going from focused to space non stop. Did you go out drinking or something. I go to reply to him and get half a sentence out and then start slurring my words and went to space and started blacking out. He was really concerned and then it hit me I didn't have these symptoms last time. I went to the bathroom and googled it and yep go to hospital. 
So I called my doctor and saw him. He's like you look bad stay off them we are doing tests and you ain't working. Well actually more doctors came in to check up on me. I haven't got my results back but I believe I was in the early stages. So that makes my work think less of me. I looked like I was drunk all week. 
Im now really scared to try a new med but im scared not to be on meds. 
Have any of you had better luck with other meds. I'm just slightly panic attacking knowing regardless witch way I go I'm going to be out of it at work :(  Hey,
Yes I have been on it before and the only reaction I got was dry mouth, food tasting strange, the taste of salt in my mouth and only having 5 seconds to get to the bathroom. 
But this time, I can't even lay straight as my belly is so upset, and just seriously in space but getting worse each day. And boohya last night I noticed I got a uti. So I'm slightly scared if it has attacked my kidney. Not fun passing blood. 
I went straight on 750mg. That's what I did last time. 
Ive told work earlier that I'm on a new medication and one of the side effects is needing to go the bathroom a bit more until I get ammuned to it. So if I'm off the floor a bit it's for a reason and they where great with that. Then when I felt at my worst I went and saw the big boss who was like you don't look good and have been acting weird and I told her I'm on a new medication and I've just called my doctor and they say I need to come in ASAP. I told her it looks like it's posioning me and I need to seek hell asap. She then was like how you getting home and I'm like public transport and she's like hell no you in your state can't get a train call your husband. Then when I called my boss to say I'm not allowed to work she's like that's ok  you don't need to tell me what meds you are on just keep me updated if you need more time off. So I thought that was good they where not pushy. 
My GP sends me to my Phyc when he started to figure out I don't just have Deppresion. I just hate seeing him. I feel like a billion times worse. Hopefully my gp can figure something out good. Due to where my Deppresion is and not being medicated he's making me do a few more visits then normal. 
  That's no good you ended up in hospital. I got zero clue why this time it made me sick. I'm drinking water, getting my tests done but well you know how it feels I was just getting worse. Lucky I haven't ended up in hospital. Came close to fainting many times but didn't. Be interesting to see what the bloods say. 
Did you feel really out of it or physically sick dehydrated if you don't mind me asking? 
I just hate the idea of having to try a new medication out. Having that weird feeling on it when you start something new and not knowing if it wil work or not. 
This will be my 6th meds they will be putting me on. Just a bit over it. I think I'm going to get a script but not start taking them until the lithium and weird feeling is out of my system and I can have a few days not feeling like I'm in space.  Hey guys might be a bit of a personal question but how do you deal with being in a relationship with bipolar? 
Me personally I'm struggling. I feel so bad for my husband having to be married to me. He's a beautiful guy and deserves a person who he doesn't need to follow room to room making sure they don't anything silly. He deserves some one who can give him a family. 
I just feel like I'm holding him back. I love him so much I want him to enjoy his life and think it's better if I'm gone.  Hello I'm Loula, 
I've been diagnosed with Bipolar for 2 years but recently Bipolar 1 Rapid Cycle. 
I have been on 5 different medications one made me toxic 3 sent me to zombie land and the latest one is working with my mania but not my depression. Looking like we will add a new tablet as I refuse to go any higher on my current as I'm functioning on it but I know if I go higher I will go zombie like. 
I work full time and can't be a zombie. I rather enjoy the highs of mania then be an out of work zombie. Why are the manias so good at times? 
Ive got a question mabye someone might be able to help me with. Doctors are great but I rather talk to someone that's going through it. I hope that's ok. 
On my new medication I can feel my brain rapid cycling. I can feel the urgers of going mania but then it's like the medication has a booming voice and is like I don't think not, we will behave and be responsible. Then my brain has a mini war and it's just the weirdest feeling. I've told my doctor he's not concerned but I'm not sure if that's just because I didn't go crazy and buy 100 pairs of shoes. Has anyone else felt like this? I know everyone is different but I thought I would ask. 
Also is anyone a mum with Bipolar? I'm thinking in the next 3-5 years starting a family and I just like to know some info. I'm reading blogs. Some make me feel strong and some give me pure fear. 
  Hi Quirkywords, 
I found my way on this page. Thank you for telling me about it. It's good to see you where not turned of having children and even experiencing a low having a third. 
I'm not pregnant as I can't on my medication as it will cause great harm to the baby. It's just something very much on mind as I'm nearly 30 and married for 5+ years. 
Im just a planner. I like everything scheduled. And yes I know you can't really schedule a child but I can my support groups and routine and some things. 
Thats great you had good support. From everything I have read support is needed. All my gf who have kids say they need support and that I would most likely just need a bit more with my mental health. 
Im just scared of being pregnant and getting sick or being a bad mum or doing a runner. When I get sick I run. I run from all responsibility. 
Yes I will have to read the previous conversations but there's a lot of pages so I might not get through all of them so sorry if I repeat a subject. 
Have a great week 
x  Hi velvetfaerie, 
Medication can be the worst! I hate it! I've had the zero emotion one. It was like you where stuck. Never felt like I was on speed but I had one that made me feel like I had 10 tequila shots in 10 minutes lol. That was walking down the street on. Note to self and others, don't try new medication and go shopping. 
Thats inpresive your doing it with out medication and working full time and studying. I tried it. I did good for a while. Learnt how to use my mania for good eg cooking. But my depression hit a dangerous lol and I had to get medicated. Then it's been 2 years on and off trying new ones and me going I can do it on my own and then boom. 
Regarding work they noticed me acting weird and where actually worried as I was not able to carry a conversation and thought I had a big weekend or was sick. I thought it was all in my head feeling like this and lucky he told me as I was going toxic. Due to that I had to let me work know. I work for a large company so they got to be good to me. But I'm lucky I got really nice bosses that understand. I'm just honest with them if I'm doing a change or sick and can't take on extra work as you know having bipolar we like to go 24-7 and I think they like that lol. 
May I ask if you don't burn of your energy in a fun healthy way it turns negative against you? 
  Hi Meercat, 
Thank you for the welcome. 
Wow 43 diagnosed. I'm assuming it would of been very hard back then with the little know about Bipolar. You would of seen a lot of the changes with how mental health and people with bipolar have been treated and viewed. 
Thats great your working to with Bipolar. It's really encouraging me seeing there's a few of you working with it. At the moment I'm finding work hard and hiding in the bathroom crying saying I can do it I can do it. But I know it's a season but it's just hard. I just wish sometimes people know how hard it is for us at times. 
Thats not good you went toxic and zombie like. I know what's that's like. It sucks and add a few more colourful words. 
Thats good your feeling in more control with the medication change. I'm scared if they introduce a new one I'm going to go zombie or feel funny. I just hate it. 
Good on you for only buying one bag. I've brought a pair of shoes, two sets of pjs, 5 dresses a top and bag the last month. Whoops. But it's not due to mania it's due to just being so sad. I want to feel full. I want a moment of happiness. 
Thats great since joining this page you have felt strong enough to talk out. 
Have a great week 
xxx Hi meercat, 
I'm lucky I work for a good company. I work in sales. Which is good except the days I can't tolerate people. Which is what happening at the moment. 
Being supper organised helps. I also got food in the freezer. I love cooking but if I'm ill I don't cook so I like to have back up food or and simple menu planed for the week to get me by. 
Im good with clutter in the head. I got a billion storage files in the brain lol. I come from an abusive family and spent my child hood in therapy as I was an angry child. They never thought to stop the abuse just get the therapy. So for most of my life I've been good at keeping a clear head in a thinking way unless medicated on something to strong. 
Good on you getting coffee with someone this week. I've gone months with out seeing friends. It's so hard. Hope it all goes good. 
Hey Qurikywords, 
hope your having a good day.  And boom feeling really low. Keep going low to yucky lol in seconds. I'm all teary now. Really over this. Just want some stable time. Hate feeling worthless and that I'm just not right. That I'm a mistake. Hate the physical pain depression brings and hate just feeling empty. I'm going to have a mini cry now and hide in my bed.  Hi quirkywords, 
I hate the thud! At least give me a yellow traffic light. I've read the first elevator post. Just sums up the non joy of our life. Some times though I feel like it's going in slow motion and then sometimes it's a billion times faster. The joy of rapid cycle, 
Im the same sometimes the cry helps and sometimes it just makes me worse. 
I generally don't like to show emotions. I want people to see me as together. All my friends know I'm sick but I want to come across tough and not effected. I don't want to be treated sick so I act not sick. If that makes sense.  Hi Quirkywords, 
I'm on and off. I'm like a yo-yo going from deppresed and dropping to more deppresed back to general deppresed. 
Im not sleeping. My brain is getting active. 
I just want to be treated normal as everyone else but they will never ever happen. I found people treat us different because they are asholes, they don't want to hurt us, the are undereducated and many more reasons. 
Thanks for the welcome Issi. 
Dosent the thud suck velvetfaerie. Hope it doesn't hit you hard. All I can suggest though if you feel it coming get prepared.  Positive step.
Generaly my GP is treating me for my bipolar with a psychiatrist help. He's been doing a great a job but as we need to introduce a new medication as my highs are treated but my lows are not and I had a full blown break down in the doctors office I saw my psychiatrist and looks like we got a good treatment plan ahead.
I will now also just be getting treated by my psychiatrist and start talking about all the things in my head and try figure out why I feel like I'm hovering out side of the world watching it. 
So I start my new anti depressants tomorrow. I'm praying hard it dosent make me feel horrible and actually works. Everything crossed. 
Sorry one thing you will get to know about me is I wrote what's in my head to keep my head clear.  Full blown breaking down. 
Im trying to be positive going the new medication is going to work and make me happy and then I'm going to live a good full life and be the person I want to be. 
But then I listen to my soul and it's like you need medication to be happy. You don't need one type of tablet but now you suck so much you need 2! And who knows if this is going to work. Who knows if your ever going to get treated. 
I just can't stop getting tear eyes. I hate that I just can't be happy on my own and that sucks.  And boom let's bring along the side effects! My hands won't stop shaking. My tummy is so upset and I got a headache and the best part is im at work and the toilets are up 5 flights of stairs!!!  Hi Quirkywords words. 
Was not fun. Yes have had the sea sickness feeling on other anti depressants before but never the shaking of the hands. Symptoms are still there coming in waves but saw my doctor who said it's 100% normal. 
My work was good I just said I may need an extra break or sit down. As soon as I noticed my hands where shaking I went into a full blown panic attack but some how calmed myself down. 
So fingers cross my belly and hands settle down and my brain likes these tablets then boom I can tick something of my list.  Hi Lady_Stardust 
Diet will majorly improve your fatigue. It will change so much. But I can't really speak because when I'm low I live on chocolate chips and burgers. I have no clue why but I just go to it. 
I fully understand what you mean by hate your house and everything is the same. I feel at times trapped in my house but my friends are far I can't visit them and I don't want to go out on my own. It's no fun. What I do and sounds silly is design my dream house. I'll never afford it but it takes my mind out of my house. I also sometimes by a new poster or change the furniture around in my place. Makes it feel different. 
Hopefuly the vicious cycling of not sleeping till late and feeling down will start to stop soon. We all know it dose stop it just sucks when your in it. 
I hope you have a better day today xxx Hi guys, 
Strange question but do any of you have private health insurance? 
I was woundering if that's something I should get having mental health? 
I've never been hospitalised for my bipolar. I should of but my husband literally supervised me for days. But from what I've heard the public mental health hospitals are not great for people with bipolar or just in general. Is that true? 
I'm also thinking if I decide to get pregnant if I would want to go private as I would not want to get lost in the system and I know I will need a lot of mental health support.
But last night I looked at the price and laughed my head off. It's literally unaffordable. Like it's a joke. What do the people do who can't work? Like I work and this is way to pricy.  Hi Quirkywords, 
I wounded why we crave bad food when we are down? Like nothing else is appealing and I swear the bad food gives me energy. 
Yeah im just trying to weigh it all up with the insurance. Some people swear by it some hate it. Some love the public health system some hate it same as private. 
I just don't want to risk it if I have children incase I get sick. 
Im actually doing good. My depression is lifting which is nice. I think these new anti depressants are agreeing with me except I'm getting a bit of anxiety. 
I am though freaking out about work for the month. My hours will be different week to week and can change mid week and lots of late nights which is different as I'm on a set roster so I know I'm going to hate that. It's the really busy period to so that's going to stress me out. Every year I generally get sick around this time due the fact everything changes and my routine is blown up. I just hope my medication keeps me straight.  Hey Lady Stardust 
Desiging your dream house is so much fun and calming. I love it. I love checking out the quricky houses with the hidden rooms and bathrooms with free standing baths. 
Im glad your starting to feel a bit better. Nothing beats a good cry. Yea it can be hard to tell when your hypomania especially when it's not a intense strong one. Unlike your depression that you can tell straight away. One thing my husband has noticed with me is when I'm get hypomania i tend to not be able to sit still. I look around a lot. I use my hands heaps. I fidget. Mabye you can look at those behaviours and see if you do them. Like I had no clue I was doing it till he told me and now I notice it. 
It's funny how all 3 of us crave bad food @quriqywords. There must be something in the food that gets us going. Because like I feel like I need it to function if that makes sense but I know it's probably the worst thing for me when I'm down but I just don't care. 
I have found for people with bipolar we need schedule. Im just praying the medication holds out. I might see the doctor if there's anything he can give me if I get overwhelmed or crying in the toilet. I just don't want to return to my old coping ways as they where not healthy.  And boom! My fear came true, losing it at work. But the customer was a cow that didn't want to be serverd by me as she asked why I was shaking and I said it's due to medication and she's like I want someone that's not medicated to serve me and started complaining about me so I gave her a mouthful. My college and boss where like boom good on you. They got my back!
 I really struggle with the fact I need medication to be happy and as you know I'm on a new one so my body is a bit messy and I just hate it. Then to be judged on it by a stranger just made me feel so worthless. I ended up in the toilet crying as all the shame of being medicated and having bipolar came up and I just wanted to self harm but I didn't, it was hard but I didn't!!! Though I know I need to find something that's going to help me. A quick coping strategy. Rant over.
Lady Stardust see you already know some of your symptoms you know just need to learn to watch for them for yourself. I do have good strategys at home when I'm sick like movies and drawing but at work I can't do that lol. Yes I agree we need special food days but at the moment every meal is special food day haha.
Airies you eat nice and healthy. I'm the same I don't do New Years resolutions manly because if I want to change something or set a goal I'll do it anytime in the year.
Issi did you figure out what your craving? If not I think you should eat Thai food. Must be strange going from something to nothing. But honestly uss this time to do what you love. Once you start working it will be work work work. Don't waste this time. Trust me!
 Hey Lady Star Dust 
For a year I refused to go on medication as I am so ashamed of it and hate it. Then I started trying medication and had many issues until now and I've just started accepting it that I need medication because I personally like the fact I'm running better on it. But now I just feel really ashamed of it again. I can't see it as like how you try to describe it and also every doctor. I see it as I need a pill for my brain to be happy and it's horrible. I just feel like a Less of a person. I feel defective and broken. 
More of my colleges heard of what happened and are like we never heard of something so bad being said and they are like you are perfect and amazing and had some colourful words about the customer and I've never heard any of them swear before lol! I'm glad I stood my ground with her and finished the shift. Most where like we would of gone home or been speechless. 
Its good your starting to watch for warning signs. I find it really helpful so I can get ready for the storm. 
And Boom on Gay Marriage. Exciting!!!! 
Hi Quirkywords, 
I can't believe I came up with something to say on the spot. But I don't let people walk over me. I hate when people who don't know about my illness try to advice me on what treatment I should use like herbals and all that stuff.  Hi guys, Lady_StarDust & Qurikywords, 
I know what your trying to say but I just hate it. But I have accepted I need it to function and I'm better on it. But i hate the way it makes me feel, my head is always slightly blurry and my hair is now falling out!!! What's with that!!!!!! Fingers cross that stops. There's just times I can feel I got tablets in me and wiring my brain and I hate it and want to detox my body and be drug free and live on fruit and vegs but I know deep down that's a bad idea but I still feel like screaming. 
No more mean customers at work thankfully. I talked to my doctor about it who just told me to tell them it ain't there business why my body shakes and some stuff to help me calm down as I get overwhelmed this time of year and zero schedule. It's really hard my schedule being 100% gone. I can't even cook or clean and my hubby's not getting it. 
I never think less of my friends but I've been brought up to see the beauty in everyone and to help everyone. I think though if I had a friend with mental illness I would be causes around them not because I felt uncomfortable just because I would never want to trigger them which is a bit hypocritical as we want to be treated normal but I hate being triggered. Dose that make sense? 
Mabye one day I won't feel broken but it hard when you come from a broken home, where told all through school your broken by teachers and parents and then find out your mentally ill.  Hello, 
Unfortunately I can't change/create a new schedule. I'm use to working 9-5 5 days straight and now it's 8-5 or 1-10 and everything in between scattered. And it's just throwing me badly. 
And the new medication side effect is boom not sleeping and active dreams so I'm so exhausted. The doctor has got a strategy to help that so fingers cross it works. 
I just feel like I'm on a thin string walking very straight and determined but a slight breeze I'm going to fall.  Hi Lady_Stardust no I haven't told my doctor about my hair loss. Hopefully it is just stress. I've noticed I'm shallow breathing and having mini anxiety attacks so I must be stressed. 
My mum made a good point tonight that I'm not doing well with my schedule being changed and all that is that generally I'm not medicated and go mania and go go go go go go with out getting tiered until I crash hard but because I'm medicated I'm getting tired and notice stress but I shouldn't crash. 
How have you been anyway? 
Ho Quirkywords thank you for your kind words. The dreams are starting to slow down thankfully and I'm getting a few more hours sleep. 
How have you been? 
Keep at it Issi, I know it can suck but the perfect job will come. I had to try for 6 months before I got hired. It hurts but don't take it personally. I know easier said then done. 
Hi Velvetfaerie yes I 100% do push people away. I don't mean to but I feel trapped by them and I don't need it but we both know we do need them. Hope your ok. If you need to talk I'm hear x  Aaarrrggghhhhhhh fell off!!!!! 
I can feel myself cycling but my brain won't let me act out and I feel the emotions trapped in me and it's painful. Not sure if that makes sense. 
Had to leave work ill due to the tablet my doctor gave me to calm me down well let's say I calmed down so much I don't remember the day. 
I feel so anxious and shaky non stop and my hair is getting worse!!!! I got zero appetite and I'm just hating it. 
I feel non stop on edge and racing and I'm not liking it.  Hi Guys Merry Late Christmas. 
OMG I'm tiered!!! Dam retail! I got back up on the rope and slowly walking thankfully. Having a few panic attacks but I seem to be able to control them. 
Unfortunately I can't do deep breathing. Many doctors have tried to take me through it but slowing myself down when I'm upset actually makes me worse. Weird. The doctors are like ok and your now shaking and crying don't try that again lol! 
At home I got many great distractions that help me but at work I can't start drawing or watching DVDs. 
Hell yes I'm the same with planing. I have everyday planed out. My birthday ain't for 6 months and I got the dress and cake brought. I have every day organised and I have a back up plan if the day dosent go correct. Are you guys ok if the plan dosent go correct? Me I generally adapt very fast and get on with it but when the day is up then the Bipolar hits me if that makes sense? 
Thats no good your in a toxic environment. Have you made your bedroom your escape zone? Decorated it? Made it yours? That helped me as I grew up in a abusive home and my room was my safe zone.  Oh man I got plan b c and d lol! I'm an over planner. Makes me feel in control. 
I love my bed to! It's my biggest safety place. That's where I need to be when I'm down. It's like a hug in a way. 
Lucky you where your own boss. Yes Retail ouch.  Do you ever feel like you have been diagnosed wrong? Like I'm watching a show and a character with Bipolar and I'm like I don't act like him. I'm feeling really well at the moment and as though I got everything in control. I don't think I need the medication anymore. I don't think I've never needed it. I think I just had a bad day. I've talked to my husband though and he's like no you have bipolar but I would know better.  Hi guys sorry about being away. Just lots of thinking and organising. Good news is my schedule is 100% back to normal! I made it with only one sick day!!!! A few close ones but I got through it. 
Qurikywords your right about the over dramatic of tv. I've spoken to close friends and family and they all agree I have bipolar. I saw my doctor the other day and he's so excited how well I'm doing. The puzzle of the medication is pieced together nearly. I only have to see him every second month now or if hell breaks lose. Haha I don't drive to! I'm going to start learning now though as the new medication dose not make me feel like a zombie. How have you been anyway? And relax pfft hate when people say that!!!! 
issi I know it sucks applying for jobs especially after you studied. It took me over 6 months to get a job. I had interviews at my dream places and didn't get them and I would cry. But then all of a sudden I was offered the job I have now and I 100% believe I didn't get the other jobs as this is where I am meant to be. Most nicest staff and support team and I love working. So trust me the perfect job will come along. 
Hey lady_stardust! That's no good your not sleeping great. I go through that as well. I'm really strict and put myself in bed at 9pm even though my brain is active till 1/2am lol. But after a while with routine I start to get a better sleeping pattern. I don't like your not happy at home. I really relate to that. Can you ask your family my bedroom is my place please knock but do it when they are and you are calm to not cause world war 3? Oh I love a road trip. When I'm at my low my husband puts me in the car and we just drive. Also tell that dragon to get a new hobbie because you are worth everything!!! 
Hey Vevetfaerie, dam PMS!!! It makes me literally the worst person in the world. The only one semi good thing about it is my uncontrollable need for chocolate. I fully understand the tiered feeling. Your body is emotionally wreched. It takes time to heal. I've been in that situation. One thing though when you start to feel semi ready get some fresh air. As we all know when we are healing we can get a bit comfortable. You don't want to push yourself til you get ill but you need a goal. Me I trained for a marathon and went to all the art galleries in the city on my own to get use to the sound of humans. Hope your start feeling like you soon. 
Hope you all are enjoying your holidays x
  Let's get one thing settled! Chocolate is never ever bad for you!!!! Last night I had chocolate icecream and watched Gilmore Girls in bed and had the best sleep ever!!!! And if anyone tells you different death stare them! 
Lady_Stardust that's so great your mum was with you and let you help get out the yucky feelings. I'm the exact same I need sugar food when I'm stressed. I just fall apart with out it. My partner can tell something is up when I start every morning with chocolate and a can of Coke. I'm not sure if you have a Lush body store near where you live but if you have a bathtub get the bathbomb that's a robot. It's lavender and really calming or any items with lavender. 
Argh my step dad was like that. Annoying!!!! But you can still make your room your safe area. 
Velvetfaerie your 100 not responsible for anyone! As much as we want to sometimes we can't be there even though our heart wants to. You know you don't have the energy to help. Get your self well. We all have been there and 100% know that feeling and it sucks!!!! I had a bunch of friends that never helped me but expected help 24-7 and I decided friendships should be 50/50 and it wasn't so I deleted them from my life and these are bestfriends of over 10 years. Hardest thing to do but you know what I'm so happy now. 
Qurikywords, when you going to take a break? 
  Hey Velvetfaerie, dam the food poisoning. That's the worst! That's great you have started saying no to the not as good friends. It's a really rewarding feeling. It's like your reclaiming your life in a strange way. Yay to animal videos! What's your favourite animal? Mine is a 3 way draw of Cat, Shark and Turtle! 
Lady Stardust yay to lush and that's a great idea taking on tasas point of planing the day. I do it and best thing ever! Now sweetpea the joy of our illness is sometimes we can't get the emotions we want to be potraide on the surface or really even feel them. Dam depression part!!!! But one thing I can assure you as you said you have pure love for your nephew! Love is the most important thing. I know it would be nice to be jumping around with the family but knowing you have 100% opened your heart to someone new and so pure and just want to protect is amazing! Don't forget that!  Hi Velvetfaerie, they are very smart. I think there was a documentary about them and how they would copy people and put rubbish in the bin and go down slides. Unfortunately I don't like them but my school was covered by them and I had to do a maths/science assignment on them on how many in an area. And when you where having a test they would be going off and you weren't allowed to chase them away in case a class was counting them lol!!!!! 
I just don't get why people are into them self. It's all about them. And it hurts when you give them so much time and love and when you need it you get zero! 
Documentrays are so great to watch. I love animal ones. 
Haha nothing beats a hang over. Group question do all of you drink or not? If so how dose it effect you? Like I know our conditions and medication says not to but you know I'm human. 
Weight is really hard one. I had one tablet that put 2 dress sizes on me!!!! I find clean eating is good but then again I love food. So I have like one extremely naughty day a week lol! 
Velvet may I ask why you are bored in life? You seem a bit down. If you want to chat I got the day off and will be on hear. I have those days when I'm like it is boring and what am I meant to do. So you at least have someone to talk to that will actually understand you.  I'm the same I'll have a few drinks and then not for a while. Dosent seem to effect me as well and I don't get drunk quicker. 
Water diet gosh I would of turned into the scariest person. When I go raw people hide lol!!!! 
Naughty day means all the food I love shopping, hanging with my friend or staying in bed with a food fort watching Netflix lol! What ever my head can take on the social part I do but food is a must lol!  That's so true Velvetfaerie it depends on what you drink. Good on you making your own fun. I have to do that. I've taught myself to bake, I go to art galleries, protests for things I'm passionate about, read, take dancing leasons. What ever I can think of. 
I don't like your in a yucky phase at the moment. Hopefully after a good sleep you will feel better.  OMG the gym! I think the longest I've been in the gym in 20 minutes. I wish I loved it and could get that good feeling from it but I just know it's a waste of money for me. I did start running for months but hurt my back. I enjoyed that and hopefully get back into it. 
I like to bake cake and obviously chocolate cake! When I'm manic I stayed up for days and would teach myself baking. 
Love the smell of and old books to. It's like they have a story of them own besides the storie inside of the. Music is great to.  I describe my eating habits the same as bear. I will go for days eating then eat barley nothing. 
Cleaning? What is that you are talking off? I was a teen too and left it for mum because after I finished making the cakes I was onto the next activity. 
Quriky what cake you like? 
Velvet are we seeing someone? Just be yourself with the mother that's all I can advice.  Glad to hear it Velvetfaerie. 
I woke up shocked to the news she passed away. Love that band! I had zero clue she had Bipolar airies. Hopefully that was not a reason or one of the reasons into her tragic death.  Meh!!! So annoyed! I have a grumbling appendicitis but not bad enough for hospital but bad enough to be discomfort. I've been suffering from it for years and there's nothing they can do unless it's going to blow. It's fustrating me so much!!!!! 
Dose anyone have weird dreams on there medication? Like I've also been an active dreamer but this is hard to explain. Before my normal dreams they felt deep in my brain but my latest dreams feel more awake and under my eyelids. I'm thinking it might be because I'm dreaming through different parts of my sleep cycle that you normally don't dream in. But I get like 4-5 a night. 
  Am I actually happy? Or is it the medication making me be a functional human? Like is the deepest part of me truly happy or am I meant to be ill? Like I don't want to live a lie. I want to be me and free.  Hi Everyone, 
I love how David Bowie kept changing himself. True artist. Oh Floyd!!!! I love DSOTM!!! I got and early edition on vinyl. I've actually be collecting early rock and roll on vinyl because I love the distortion sound. It sounds pure. And it's the closest I will ever come to seeing theses bands. 
PMS AAARRGGGHHHH!!!! I get a bit grumpy and in need of chocolate. I've been on many pills as I actually get horrific pain but all they do is make me sick. Bring on menopause lol! 
No nothing I can do about my appendix. Pain killers arnt even touching it. I just got to gritt my teeth and work. 
No I don't believe everyone is 100% happy. That would just be scary. I just want to have the normal level of happiness and sadness as a person with non bipolar. I just don't want to take these tablets daily to make me function. I shouldn't need a tablet to make my head work.  And Boom like that I have lost more then 50% of my hair!!!!!! 
sorry haven't been on hear a bit will read through and reply when I get out of my arrrrggghhhhhhhh I'm going Bold!!!!!!  Medication!!!!! My BF saw it and was like omg your hair is so thin. I run my hands through it and hand fulls are falling out. If I brush it my hair brush is full and the ground around me of hair. There's piles of hair all around my home!!!!  Hello everyone. Sorry I’ve been away. My head is going 24/7! My appendix has fully settled down thankfully. I was so scarred I would end up in hospital. 
pls excuse my messy reply to everything I’ve read. 
I saw my hairdresser about my hair who I trust. She’s seen this many times before and told me everything I’m doing is correct in the way of looking after it. She also checked my scalped and could see all new hair growing slowly coming through everywhere. She’s never seen anyone go bold but couldn’t believe how curly my hair is due to the medication lol. She’s had many clients lose as much as me and boom then it’s all back. So I’m breathing a bit. 
I find it all interesting we love music. Do a lot of you like to do a form of art? I’ve read people with bipolar are creative. 
Me I’m personally scared of silence. I hate my thoughts. I need noise to even fall asleep. But when I’m sick sick dangerous sick I just sit in silence for hours and my husband knows he needs to watch me 24-7. 
I can find it when everything is good and even when I’m having a good weekend away I can get sad and empty. It’s like hello nothing has set it off but the feeling is real. And people that tell me to be happy well can we make a new law we can kick them? 
My long weekend was actually great. Beach and beach and beach. It gives me a sense of freedom and makes me want to be a mermaid which is a good feeling lol! 
Personal question only answer if your comfortable. Do any of you feel over emotional after sex? I generally feel dirty, rotten and like rubbish and I cry so much even though the love making is romantic and I’ve never been sexually abused. My doctor thinks it’s rather strange behaviour as its the behaviour that normally is affiliated with an abuse victim. 
Well I’m hope your all doing good. Sorry for being gone for so long and hello to the new cool cats.  Hello everyone. Sorry I’ve been away. My head is going 24/7! My appendix has fully settled down thankfully. I was so scarred I would end up in hospital.

Well I’m hope your all doing good. Sorry for being gone for so long and hello to the new cool cats.  And boom my appendix is hurting again. Seeing the doctor in the morning. So over this!!!!  I’m in the waiting room now. I hate waiting rooms!!! The only good thing is when you see a sweet old couple come in looking after each other and can see love in their eyes. It’s a beautiful sight long lasting love. 
Hopefully the figure something out. But I doubt it. Just be rest of it gets worse go to hospital but need to the note for work. Annoying!!! 
  I just love old people! They are so cute!!!
 Velvetfaerie in a perfect world it would but I don’t have private health insurance nor is it a life threatening illness so it will elective surgery and gosh how many years will I wait for that lol! I’m also so scared about going under. Haha we got nothing to do. I would be like hell no!!!! 
I had my bloods done and got butchered and now look like a junkie! My white blood cells are high. I had the scan and randomly had major pain around liver and I swear he wrote blood spot so I’m freaking as I took a lot of painkillers to numb the pain for a while but no doctor knows it. But when they do they blood tests on them they come back ok. Well I’ll know more tomorrow. 
Im feeling good and weird. It’s like I’m relearning my emotions again. Like if I get excited I’m like am I getting too excited is my meds off and my husband is like no this is normal. Your acting fine and just really happy. I’m so amuned to feeling certain ways this is strange and hard to get use to and understand. Dose that sense?  Not sure why the WBC are high and where from. But I’ll get results tomorrow. 
I don’t like you having a bad day. I agree why can’t people be nice? Or just even human? How hard is it to treat people the way you like to be treated or smile? That’s something that dose my head in. I’m having a sick day today so if you want to chat type away. 
Thank you Qurikywords for understanding how I was feeling on that. I’m glad I’m not alone. Yes I only listen to like 4 people and 2 doctors about my health. The others don’t really know me enough. I think it will be a good feeling when I know my feelings are normal and I’m use to all this level feeling. 
I’m just nervous that I’ve read people can get unbalanced on their medication. I don’t really understand it. And I’m scared it’s going to happen to me. I assume it can happen to anyone when they are stressed or people can get amuned to the medication. 
Have any of you had issues with this before. I feel like I’m still learning about my illness non stop.  Are you not medicated Velvetfaerie? 
Ive been on 5 different medications till I have found the 2 I’m on. I’ve had the weigh gain. I’ve had them make me feel worse. I’ve had them make me feel slow in the head. It’s horrible! I wish there was a one pill dose all trick. 
Are you seeing a doctor or someone regularly to help you if your doing it on your own? 
I did it on my own and thought I was surviving but had a dangerous fall so I started the medication I’m on today and I’m like omg when I thought I was surviving I barely was. 
You guys know me and how much I hate taking tablets and I just want to be human normal what ever that is. Mabye talk to your doctor about it because it sucks when your having a bad day and know you need some extra help. 
Why don’t you plan your dream holiday today. Go to a happy place?  Qurikywords words I love your words of advice. I think it works for everyone of us in every process we are in. I just wish I was super smart and could invent a pill that suits everyone for bipolar. 
Its strange how we are all so different with how our treatment works on us. Like one agrees with you but not with me. 
Velvetfaerie that’s amazing your doing this unmediated. Shows determination and inner power. That’s good you have your anxiety stash. I have one of those to as I had horrible anxiety but I’m getting really on top of it but then some days it just goes well hello I’m coming in a large wave that all your logic in your head is not going to be able to calm you down. 
OMG a year of work would be amazing!!! I know it will never happen to me. What are some of your dream holidays guys? I’ve also wanted to go Alaska in spring. See the bears teaching there cubs to catch fish. All the different types of whales and scream at the killer whales. I don’t like them. Bullies of the sea. Lol!!! 
Airies 3 hours exercising! Wow!!!!! Remember chocolate is never bad lol! Now the big question did you get potato and gravy at KFC? It’s great you had a good day with your son. Sounds lovely. 
I’m not watching Celebrity much, I just see bits. I am though watching MKR. I really want to go on that show haha. 
Enjoy your dreams tonight. I dreamt of neon snakes last night. These meds set my brain of.  Help Help Help Help!!!!! 
My anxiety levels are through the roof and getting worse! I can’t breath I can’t thibk I can’t stay still nor can I go fast! I’m trapped! I can’t do the focus on your breathing technique as it slows me down and brings me fear. (Weird I know) I’m taking prescription tablets for it and now I’m doubling on them! 
i just feel like something heavy is on me. It’s also starting to make me depressed and angry. I literally think I’m going to break down in the next day or two! But I can’t as I got to work then I’m on holidays and you think yay holidays I’ll be relaxed but hell no! Aarrrrggghhhhh feel like rubbish!  Hi guys,
sorry been a way for a while. Have actually been checking in and reading but just finding it hard to write if that makes sense. 
I went on my holiday and boom hello depression and anger! I was at beautiful beaches and I’m like no I want to stay in bed and sleep! I was not expecting that. I went to a gp on my holiday who helped me with some temporary medication until I got home which helped a lot but it’s one of those you get one script a year and the pharmacist will call the doctor to make sure he wrote out the script meds so I don’t reallly want to be taking them for long. 
I came back and saw my psychiatrist and he was really happy with what the doctor did and was like wow this is a bit of a warning sign as you where doing so great so obviously you can be shifted. 
So now I’m home into routine and I feel again sad. I feel like self harming. I feel worthless. It’s just like what I thought I had my medication and illness organised but I’ve learnt I can’t control my illness what’s so ever and it sucks.  Thankyou for the reply. It just sucks because I literally though haha bipolar I have you under control. You no longer control me but I now realise the medication is just literally a bandaid and it 100% will always be in control and can be mean when it wants to.My husband knows I’m close to self harming and doctor.
 
 And there we go!!! It’s happened.. I’ve snapped! I can’t breath, I’m screaming at people, I’m depressed, I’m high. I hate everyone including myself. I’ve also taken back to my harmful tactics of coping. I’m seeing my doctor tomorrow but I just feel mad and like I’m going to scream at him.  Hi Issi, I’m no doctor but I assume they would. I don’t eat meat and always get my iron checked to see if that’s affecting me. Because that can you make you tiered and not run correctly and when your body is not 100% I believe it can affect your mental health.  Hi Issi, I also don’t eat red meat or actually any meat. But I’ve been lucky my iron levels have been fine and I’m not a healthy vegetarian eater. I hate half the foods I need to eat. Im not sure if your stage in life or this will be helpful but have you and your doctor talked about the marina? I know a lot of people with low iron it fully helped then I know heaps of people who hated it. It ever loves you or not but something worth looking into. 
Hi Qurikywords. My appointment sucked. Just ride it out. I don’t want to ride it out!!!! Make it stop!!!  Make it stop!!!! So hello getting drunk!!! But my psychiatrists called up a psychologists and got me in today for an emergency meeting to help me figure out coping strategies. He also wanted me to keep working but I’m like I can’t I can’t be around people so I chucked a sicky.  I went to the new doctor today and she was lovely. She’s given me some new coping strategies that are fully different to anything I’ve heard before so fingers cross they start working. 
I really don’t want to work at the moment but my psychiatrist and new psychologist both want me working and keeping busy so I don’t fall into a deeper depression. But I feel like my battery’s are on empty and I’m going to blow. I’m just going to take it Day at a time and fingers cross I get through the next 5 days of work.  Hi Tams, 
how good is the bathroom!! It’s my home away from work lol. My safety zone. I’m glad you had a productive day and pushed through.
My issue with my work is I’m in retail so I got fun staff and supportive boss as she knows what’s wrong but customers. Omg!!!! Normally it’s water of a ducks back and now it’s like they are sucking the soul at me. No care for anyone and I’m a very caring positive speaking person so 1. It confusises me seeing ugly peoples talk down to strangers and 2. I’m depressed I don’t need that! 
I got through yesterday but used my naughty coping strategies. But I got through it and then went on a shopping spree! I’m going high low so fast I can’t keep up. Right now I want to go out and party haha. 
thanks Qurikywords words for being proud. You know I’m a fighter but the doctors are like my gosh you are are harsh on your self because I expect perfection.  I think we should do a clap for toilets. 
i find customers so hard. I have very rude ones that expect I kiss there butt. I don’t deal with that. And I’m high up so I have to deal with them and staff isuess. 
When I am rapid it’s fine but as soon as I stop omg I can sleep for years. It’s the worst. 
Thats good you got diganoused Tams20. I found it for me it helped me understand why I am me. It answered so many questions. I have bipolar 1 and also a rapid cycler. Hopefully you find the medication helps and don’t be disappointed if it doesn’t work don’t get upset as there’s so many and you will find what works. 
You can ask the other girls on hear I hated being on meds and knowing I have to take them for life. People try and tell me well people with diabetes take medication and it’s not different but I’m like pfft this is my head! But once I found medication that actually worked I could make a statue out of them. I love them. I got to be me again. It was amazing. 
Its good your being positive. Me I just keep active because I’m like you ain’t going to control me. 
  Generally when I get a rude customer I put on my sweet voice and wish them the most beautiful day and you can see steam coming off them. And sometimes I put them in their place especially if they are abusive because my job title dose not say I have to be threatened and swon at but customers. 
Well I got through working the week! And guess what!!!! Today I don’t have to visit the bathroom!!!! 
Slowly my thoughts on medication is changing since I have found something that has helped me. Trying to find it though and being new to it. Arrrggghhhhhh!!!!! I’m glad I have great doctors and loved ones.  Hi Tams :) 
winge away! Everything you said most of us relate to. So don’t apologies!!!! 
I understand the feeling both up and down together. It’s like omg what is happening. I got zero clue why it happens but I’ve just learnt to wait it out. 
I know it’s easier said then done but don’t be hard on your self. It’s a lot to take in and you are really going to rediscover who you are. As Qurikywords said your doing everything positive and right. Seeking help, going on medication and having a support group online. I’ve found this page literally a life saver. 
Now i 100% understand the struggle of getting something small done. It’s painful!!! I’m like some days why can’t I even cook dinner? I literally felt stuck. Like I was frozen in time while my friends are know having children getting promotions and buying houses. It sucks big time!!! 
But I had to keep telling myself to stop comparing myself to others and do stuff at my time. So my foot steps may be microscopic to my friends I know I am moving forward. I’ve also allowed myself not hate myself for not achieving things like job promotions at a certain age and I’m literally just living in the now. Taking it Day by day. Seeing the new me and I’m liking it. Its taken me years to accept it, you can read my previous posts/rants. 
but again don’t be harsh on your self. Just take little steps and know we are so proud of you and 100% know what it is like and have your back!  So had my second meeting with my psychologist. So besides the fact I have Bipolar 1 rapid cycle, anxiety issues they are now thinking I have PTSD!!!!!!! Hell No!!!! I’m not adding another illness to my list. Ain’t no body got time for that and I don’t really want to face it. I’m just going to say I had a yucky childhood upbringing disease. Some one bring me cake!  I want a chocolate cake that’s warm with chocolate icing and fresh strawberry’s and icecream that is 100% fat free please. 
my head is starting to get foggy with the thoughts of a new diagnosis. Hi my name is blank and I have bibolar 1 that rapid cycles, anxiety and PTSD do you want to be my friend and hang out with me. Aarrgghhh. I’m feeling overwhelmed and shuting down. It’s like a story that’s keep getting worse.
